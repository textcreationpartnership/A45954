            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take not upon me in this place fully to Diſcuſs the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Perplexity of the Conclave of 1670. which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above four months, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Cardinal <hi>Emilio Altieri</hi> entered, with others of his Promotion, before he had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44266:3"/>appeared in Purple, becauſe he was raiſed to that Dignity few dayes before the death of <hi>Clement</hi> IX.</p>
               <p>It is however neceſſary to know by what Intrigue that good Old Man came to be <hi>Pope,</hi> for <hi>the better underſtanding of what hath ſucceeded ſince his exaltation, wherein his ſhare has been as ſmall,</hi> as it was in the conduct of the whole Government of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> IX. <hi>Julio Roſpiglioſi</hi> having not long ſurvived the loſs of <hi>Candie,</hi> for the preſervation of which place, the ſole Bulwark of <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the enterpriſes of the <hi>Turk</hi> he had laboured joyntly with <hi>France;</hi> the ſuddenneſs of his death gave no time to the Cardinals to ſettle their Factions, and forme Parties for the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>But, after the uſual Ceremonies of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they entered the Conclave, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> 1669: and that very night the Conclave was ſhut, rather to obſerve the Formalities, than ſeriouſly to ſet to work about a new Election.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals, that lived remote from <hi>Rome,</hi> were to be expected, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who were to bring with them the Sentiments of thoſe Crowns, concerning the Election of the Pope.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44266:3"/>
               <p>Inſomuch, that for above the ſpace of five weeks they did no more but look on one another in the Conclave. After the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Chaunes,</hi> and the Cardinals of <hi>Rets</hi> and <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> netled at the long delay made in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>French,</hi> without doing of any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs induſtriouſly protracted the coming of Cardinal <hi>Portocarrero,</hi> to let the world ſee, that the ſame reſpect was had for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Nation, as had been ſhewed for <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Cardinals being at laſt met, did but ſlowly advance the diſpatch of Affaires, becauſe Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> had framed a deſign of raiſing his Kinſman Cardinal <hi>d'Elci</hi> to the Papacy; and had promiſed him rather to burſt in the Conclave, than to give his Vote to another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Faction joyned to thoſe of the <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> and <hi>Barbarini,</hi> with many others that feared to fall again under a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy like to that of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. (which would have happened, if <hi>d'Elci</hi> had been made Pope) vigorouſly oppoſed the Project of <hi>Chigi.</hi> Nevertheleſs they would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly give the Excluſion to <hi>d'Elci,</hi> becauſe in the ſpeech that the Duke of <hi>Chaune</hi> made to the Cardinals, when he appeared in the Conclave, he freely proteſted, that he had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44266:4"/>brought no orders from <hi>France</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of any, and that the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter gave full liberty to the Cardinals to chooſe whom they ſhould think beſt; for he took them all to be perſons of ſo much Integrity and Virtue, that they would take no reſolution, but what was for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Holy See, and good of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> failed not to make the ſame Declaration in the name of the King his Maſter, as he was obliged to do, though he had had contrary Orders, that he might not render the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction odious.</p>
               <p>But, that Proteſtation on the part of the <hi>French</hi> was made more out of Policy, than on any other ground: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, notwithſtanding their excluſion, it had ſometimes happened, that he, to whom they had given it, had been for all that elected; and the ſame thing might have happened in the caſe of Cardinal <hi>d'Elci,</hi> whom they ſaw deſigned for the Papacy by <hi>Chigi,</hi> with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Florentins</hi> united together.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon they would not venture abſolutely to exclude <hi>d'Elci</hi> from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; and this encouraged <hi>Chigi</hi> ſtill in his deſign, until Cardinal <hi>d'Eſte,</hi> in his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44266:4"/>ingenuous manner, declared himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civilly to <hi>Chigi.</hi> Meeting him one day in the Conclave, he told him, "Well, my Lord Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> what do we do here? "Why don't you give us a Pope? <hi>Chigi</hi> anſwered him, we have one ready, when you pleaſe, adding, that they could not do better, than adhere to <hi>d'Elci:</hi> Cardinal <hi>d'Eſte</hi> made uſe of this opportunity to make <hi>Chigi</hi> lay aſide that thought, ſaying, <hi>Non diamo di grazia queſto faſtidio à quel buon vecchio;</hi> that is, Let us not, I beſeech you, give that good old man that trouble: that was an excluſion expreſs enough, couched in obſcure termes, to let <hi>Chigi</hi> and his party know, that their deſign of making <hi>d'Elci</hi> Pope would not ſucceed, and that if he ſhould be propoſed without effect, it would be a means to encreaſe his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſeeing he was already ill, and had not come into the Conclave, probably becauſe of his indiſpoſition; probably alſo that he might avoid the ſting of that uſual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>He that goes Pope into the Conclave, comes out Cardinal; Chi entra Papa eſce Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What influence ſoever that Declaration of Cardinal <hi>d'Eſte</hi> ought to have had, which was free enough, for ſo reſerved a man as he; yet Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> was not at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44266:5"/>all diſcouraged by it, and he never laid aſide his thoughts of making <hi>d'Elci</hi> Pope, until that good Cardinal was dead.</p>
               <p>After his death, that <hi>Chigi</hi> might not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſiſt to make one of his own creatures Pope, Cardinal <hi>Vidoni,</hi> whom (as it was known) <hi>Chigi</hi> feared, was brought upon the Stage, and was long propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid, that the <hi>French</hi> beſtirred themſelves ſeriouſly in the matter; but it is rather to be preſumed, that being perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would not ſucceed, they propoſed <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,</hi> to tire out <hi>Chigi,</hi> and to put him in the wrong, and by the ſame means to make his Party diſtruſt him, by letting them ſee his repugnancy to conſent to the Exaltation of one of his own creatures.</p>
               <p>However it be, there were many things that croſſed the election of <hi>Vidoni:</hi> he was taxed of being intereſted, and of an odd humour; that he was not affable, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful towards the Nobility, and rude to the poorer ſort of people. Beſides, it was his original ſin, as to <hi>Chigi,</hi> that he was nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the Cardinalſhip by the King of <hi>Poland:</hi> and though he was a creature of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. yet he had no other obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him for his Purple, but that of being ſent by him Nuncio into <hi>Poland.</hi> Upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44266:5"/>the ſame conſideration it was judged, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would oppoſe his Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they had reaſon to apprehend, that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had got him crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Intereſt; and the ſame King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time retired into <hi>France,</hi> after he had laid down the Crown, the <hi>French,</hi> by his meanes, would have had too much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit under his Papacy.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition of <hi>Vidoni</hi> continued long in debate, becauſe neither <hi>Chigi</hi> nor the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> durſt openly give him the excluſion: which, at laſt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did, though, out of fear, leaſt time might bring that Project to take effect, and Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> himſelf did dextrouſly engage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Some others were alſo propoſed, rather to know one anothers thoughts, than out of any deſign to have them elected Popes.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs Cardinal <hi>Brancaccio</hi> was ſpoken of in good earneſt; but the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who forgot nothing, and had freſh in mind what he had done at <hi>Naples,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> formed a Faction againſt him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> would have been cordially for him, though he was a <hi>Neopolitane;</hi> and certainly it was a very good choice, to fill
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44266:6"/>St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire with a worthy Succeſſor, as well becauſe of his Learning, Virtue, and the inclination he had for Scholars, as upon the account of the worth of his Kindred, who were by all men acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Gentlemen of credit and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>So many Cardinals of all Factions having been thus propoſed, all ſuch as were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being Popes, were afraid of nothing more than to be brought upon the Stage, and to come in play, becauſe it was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their fortune; it being almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a Cardinal, who hath been propoſed in a Conclave, can recover of the blow that is given him, or ever hope to raiſe himſelf again. And, experience ſnews us, that moſt part of the Cardinals, who have been propoſed, and have had many voices, die under the Pontificate of him that hath been elected to their Excluſion.</p>
               <p>Thus again above a Month they looked upon one another, without doing any thing: until the ſeaſon beginning to advance, and grow hot; and perceiving that they could live no longer ſhut up, and that even many fell ſick; they reſolved at laſt in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to give a Pope to the Church. And becauſe the heads of the Factions found themſelves diſappointed of making ſuch a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44266:6"/>Pope as they deſired, they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make one proviſionally, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrate the Papacy into the hands of ſome old man, from whom no long Reign could be expected, and who might only give them time to make their Factions better againſt the time of a new Conclave.</p>
               <p>In this reſolution <hi>Barbarini</hi> and <hi>Chigi,</hi> who were wholly oppoſite, and who had given one another to underſtand, that they would burſt rather than yield, came at length to a conference together: <hi>Barbarini</hi> declared in ſhort, that he was willing that <hi>Chigi</hi> ſhould propoſe, whom he pleaſed, of the Creatures of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> that is, of thoſe of the new Colledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> deſired time to think upon it, for he had no ground to diſlike the Propoſition, ſeeing he had had the greateſt ſhare in the Reign of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. and he found none that was more at his devotion, than Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Emilio Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His age of fourſcore years was fit for the Sequeſtration; his eaſie and tractable humor, made him hope to have a great ſhare in the management of affairs: his kindred were in a degree ſo remote, that none of them were known, except a Grandchild, who was lately married to the Sieur <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paro Paluzzi,</hi> Brother to the Cardinal of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44266:7"/>that name, who is at preſent Regnant.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, all the heads of Factions had reaſon enough to be ſatisfied with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri. Barbarini</hi> found in him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient creature of his Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. who raiſed him to the Prelacy. The <hi>Florentins,</hi> who made the greateſt part of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of ſo many Popes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſucceſſively of their Nation, found in him a friend and old ſervant of the Great Duke their Prince. The <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piglioſi,</hi> and their adherents, had a Creature of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. who promoted him to the Cardinalſhip, and to whom he owed his fortune. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his perſon, as that of Cardinal <hi>Paluz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi> who was entirely at their Devotion, and who could not fail of being Cardinal Regnant, becauſe of <hi>Gaſparo Paluzzi</hi> his Brother, who was the Grandchild of <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri.</hi> And this laſt conſideration abſolutely prevailed with <hi>Chigi,</hi> becauſe Cardinal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzzi</hi> was the Creature of his Uncle <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the VII. In a word, all Chriſtendom found in him a Pope, againſt whoſe <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> none could take exception; there were, none but the Squadron <hi>Volant,</hi> made up of a good number of Cardinals, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. that judged the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Altieri</hi> to the Papacy, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44266:7"/>to their Intereſt, becauſe he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the perſecution of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. that Faction was more to be feared than all the reſt together, not ſo much for the number of voices, as the quality of thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it; the Cardinal <hi>Borromei, Pio, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periali, Azzolini</hi> and <hi>Ottoboni,</hi> the greateſt Cabaliſts of all the Colledge, were the heads thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> being now reſolved to conſent to the election of <hi>Altieri,</hi> diſcourſed the matter with <hi>Barbarini,</hi> who made a ſtrong party of the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Roſpig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioſi,</hi> as <hi>Chigi</hi> on the other hand of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventines</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> but he foreſaw ſome difficulty on the ſide of the Squadroniſts, and beſides, could hardly reſolve to make a Pope, without acquainting them therewith. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Barbarini</hi> did ſo effectually repreſent unto him, that he ought to paſs by that conſideration, and that to diſcover the project to thoſe of the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, would be the way to overthrow it; that <hi>Chigi</hi> conſented, though with great reluctancy, to break his word which he had given them, not to make any Pope, that they ſhould diſlike.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus carried on with much ſecreſie, they agreed on all the Articles of the Treaty, the moſt important for <hi>Chigi</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44266:8"/>and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> was to make ſure of the quality of Nephew in favour of <hi>Paluzzi:</hi> and though <hi>Barbarini</hi> might have ground to except againſt that, yet he ſeemed to give his conſent, as believing he ſhould be able to croſs that Eſtabliſhment, after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, by the credit that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf with <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remained now no more, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>Altieri</hi> Pope, they had more than three Fourths of the voices, of which commonly two Thirds is ſufficient; and, except the Squadroniſts, all the parties followed <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barini</hi> and <hi>Chigi;</hi> nevertheleſs they durſt not commit a matter of ſuch importance to the ordinary Scrutiny, leaſt the Squadro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſhould diſcover the Intrigue, or leſt thoſe whom they might ſuſpect, ſhould fail them; becauſe in the Scrutiny, one may give his voice for whom he pleaſes, and no man know it, and it happens daily, that you have the Canons for you, and all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt you, ſo that they took the courſe to declare him by way of inſpiration, which was done <hi>April</hi> 29. For after the uſual Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, which was made every morning, and which was that day performed in courſe; as every one was going out of the Chappel to return <hi>to their Cels until dinner time,</hi> a voice was heard all over the Conclave,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44266:8"/>
                  <hi>Altieri Papa, Altieri Papa.</hi> This conſert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by <hi>Barbarini, Chigi, Roſpiglioſi, Medici, Eſte,</hi> and all the reſt of their party ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Altieri Papa, Altieri Papa.</hi> This was a clap of thunder for the Squadron <hi>Volant;</hi> but perceiving, that all with one voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Altieri</hi> Pope, that it was a laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and that their repugnancy could not at all hinder it, they mingled their voices with the reſt, and altogether ran to the chamber of <hi>Altieri,</hi> where every one ſtrove to ſtrip him of his cloaths, that they might inveſt him in the Pontifical Ornaments.</p>
               <p>And thus was that good old man made Pope, who took the name of <hi>Clement,</hi> in memory of his Predeceſſor, to whom he was indebted for his Promotion.</p>
               <p>The firſt action the Pope did, before he went down to <hi>St. Peters</hi> Church, was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi</hi> by Adoption, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of his Family, obliging him to take the name of <hi>Altieri,</hi> and the Arms of the Houſe, which are ſix Stars Argent in a Field Azure, with a bordure Argent: to name for Datary Monſ. <hi>Carpegna</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> who was then Auditor of the Rota: and to make Monſ. <hi>Frederick Boromei</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe, Secretary of State. Theſe are the three moſt conſiderable places, which the Popes, upon their aſſumption to the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44266:9"/>beſtow commonly upon their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Confidents.</p>
               <p>The choice that the Pope made of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> and his Adoption into the Family of <hi>Altieri,</hi> gave all men occaſion of diſcourſing, and of framing different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Papacy, according as paſſion, or the opinion they had of this Nephew, afforded them matter: ſome making reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the poverty of his Houſe, which had but ſmall Rents, and great Debts, and was drained in purchaſing to him the Office of Auditor of the Chamber, and on the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the <hi>Romans,</hi> naturally inclined to raiſe money by any way whatſoever, expected no great matters under that Government, but rather all kinds of low, baſe doings and Extorſions.</p>
               <p>Others to flatter themſelves with the hopes of better fortune, corrected that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by the conſideration of the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> who being nothing at all related to the Pope in Bloud, and his employment having no other foundation, but the favour of an Adoption, would be oblig for preſerving himſelf in his place, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf with great moderation, to content all people, to make friends, or at leaſt to make no enemies, and not to give men cauſe of murmuring, who would bear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44266:9"/>leſs reſpect to him, than for the real Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of a Pope; that he had a freſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before his eyes of Cardinal <hi>Aſtalli,</hi> whoſe Nepotiſme being like his own, laſted not long under <hi>Innocent</hi> X. who being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at his Conduct, as ignominiouſly removed him from his Perſon, as he had gloriouſly called him to his Promotion.</p>
               <p>Some again, conſidering the old age of the Pope, and his humour, eaſie to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, thought they had more ground to ſay, that the Adoptive Nephew would entertain no other thoughts, but to make his beſt of the ſhort time that he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect under ſuch a Pontificate, by uſing all endeavors to raiſe his Family, and ſettle his Fortune; that he would find the leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it, for that he had to do with a Pope eaſie to be governed, who was ſo aged, as to have no other thoughts but to live in quietneſs, and to leave the management of affairs to thoſe that ſhould be about him: that there was an inſtance of a like Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of Pope <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> named <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. under whom, in the ſpace of two years, his kindred had heaped up vaſt Treaſures and Riches, built Palaces, bought Lands and Principalities, by ways known to all men.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44266:10"/>
               <p>In a word, every one reaſoned after their own manner, in a Court where men more than in any other, pretend to dive into what is to come, and where for that end, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten go as far as ſuperſtition, in conſulting ſome, who report things to come, either by Aſtrologie, or by ſome other far leſs allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more diſhoneſt Art.</p>
               <p>It was not long before men came to be clearly informed of what they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect under that Pontificate, becauſe at the very firſt, Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi</hi> (whom we ſhall hereafter call <hi>Altieri</hi>) took his meaſures to diſpoſe of all things, without ſo much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Pope, till after he had done what ſeemed beſt to himſelf.</p>
               <p>This is ſo true, that in the beginning of his Miniſtery ſome having preſented to the Pope, Petitions, for obtaining of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from his Holineſs in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which he gives all men, during the firſt days of his Exaltation, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his Holineſs himſelf, a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order: when the Will and Pleaſure of the Pope, was to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fulfilled, Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> gave the denial, ſaid, That his Holineſs had been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; and when he was preſſed, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to him, that his Holineſs had been very well informed of the matter of Fact,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44266:10"/>he ſtood not to ſay, to the great contempt of the Pope, that his memory was bad, and that he remembred not that he was already engaged to another; inſomuch, that there were ſeveral perſons to whom the Pope had given Charges, Offices, or Benefices, who never came to enjoy them, becauſe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri</hi> had given them away to others.</p>
               <p>But becauſe that began already to make ſome noiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and occaſioned ſcandal to the Church and diſhonour to the Holy See; Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> to remedy that, and at the ſame time better to ſecure his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, gave expreſs Orders to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Holyneſſes Chamber, and to all others that were about him, to let none have acceſs to the Pope without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eſpecially ſuch as had any memorial to preſent unto him.</p>
               <p>By this way of Conduct he kept the Pope beſieged, under pretext of eaſing him of the trouble of giving ſo many Audiences; and to ſpare, ſaid he, the old age of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which could not bear up under ſo many troubles and cares.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, they who were jealous of the fortune of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> failed not to make advantage of his Conduct; they taxed his Government as injurious to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44266:11"/>Holy See, tyrannical towards the People, odious to the Prelacy, and ignominious to the Pope himſelf: that he had brought his Holineſs to hear none but ſuch as ſpoke by his mouth, that he might eſtabliſh to himſelf a Monopoly, and keep his Holineſs from the knowledge of his actions; that he abuſed the eaſineſs and goodneſs of the Pope; that he intended to have a Pope in Effigie, that had ears and heard not, and a mouth and ſpake not; and to render the matter more notorious, ſome took the boldneſs to write upon the Popes chamber door, under his Holineſs Picture this biting Paſguinade, <hi>Qui ſto per inſegna.</hi> Which ſignified, that the Pope ſerved only for a Signe.</p>
               <p>There were but few that were not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the conduct of the Nephew Regnant; virtuous men living at <hi>Rome,</hi> who applied themſelves to honeſt courſes, in hopes of ſome reward, loſt their courage, when they perceived, that no Benefice, how inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſoever, came to be vacant, but that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſnapt it up, even ſmall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of ten Crowns of Rent; the Prelates ſaw the way of attaining Governments and other Charges block'd up againſt merit, that it began to be open to Bribery, and that they were diſtributed amongſt thoſe that offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d moſt money; that for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44266:11"/>there were a kind of men eſtabliſhed in the Palace, who in that Court are called <hi>Senzali,</hi> and are in plain Engliſh, <hi>Brokers,</hi> to treat under hand with thoſe that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, or might pretend to vacant Benefices.</p>
               <p>The Popes true and natural kindred, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves in great number, ſince his exaltation, whilſt when he was but a ſimple and poor Prelate, he had not ſo much as one kinſman: and he himſelf ſaid, that he did not believe he had had ſo many; that he had never found one in the time of his need; that in the neceſſity to which <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> X. had reduced him, no body had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him aſſiſtance; and that now in his grandure he found almoſt as many Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he had Townſmen: that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of kindred complained no leſs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the adoptive Nephew, who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them no ſhare, either in the Government or other affairs, except ſome of the Houſe of <hi>Maſſimi,</hi> whom he had preferred.</p>
               <p>The Colledge of Cardinals were divided, but hardly was any of them content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Nephew, for that which they might pretend immediately of the Pope, and though they could not be openly denied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his Holineſs, yet it was rendred as difficult as might be, inſomuch as to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44266:12"/>them wait whole hours in the Anticham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or to put them off till another time: and whenſoever any one was introduced to ſpeak to his Holineſs, he had Cardinal <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> ſtill by his ſide, who left him not the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpeaking confidently, but by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and troubleſome civility kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cloſe by him: or if it happened, that any one had Audience, and ſpoke freely to the Pope, his reception was cold, and with indifferency.</p>
               <p>But though all men were diſcontented, yet none durſt break out: Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> had the advantage, that there was no other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Marquis of <hi>Aſtorga</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who was more diligent in making his Courtſhip to the Courteſans of the Town, than to the Courtiers of the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace: beſide, he might promiſe himſelf all things of the humor of <hi>Altieri</hi> for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, the Cardinals of <hi>Pets</hi> and <hi>Boü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi> were gone for <hi>France,</hi> immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conclave: the Cardinal of <hi>Eſte,</hi> who uſed to make the Popes kindred tremble, tho they were protected under the Throne, and ſecured by the Pontifical Scepter, was likewiſe retired into his own Countrey. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Antonio</hi> lay languiſhing upon a ſick bed, ſo that there was none that in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44266:12"/>diſcontent, could ſupport a vigorous reſolution. The Squadron <hi>Volant</hi> troubled not themſelves, they let matters take their ordinary courſe, contenting themſelves to make parties, and form projects for a future Pope, never imagining, that he, who Reigned, might have health enough to bury them all, as he has done moſt of them.</p>
               <p>There was none but Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> Dean of the Sacred Colledge, that could undertake any thing for worſting the great great power of <hi>Altieri.</hi> It is needleſs to ſpeak here of his credit, all men know it, for all he is ſo hidden in his actions, and that he is the fitteſt man in the world to make parties (which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Vipieghi</hi>) the moſt expert in managing of them, the moſt dextrous in diſſembling them, and the moſt reſerved in ſetting them at work; that none fights better in giving ground; none hath more back doors to eſcape at; and no man appears freſher after the engagement than he, without troubling, or diſturbing himſelf, without any ſhow, unleſs it be in publick and conſpicuous actions, wherein he is all fire and noiſe even to confuſion; there being nothing elſe to be found fault with in his manners, the integrity whereof has always triumphed over the moſt crafty detraction, which is hardly to be parallelled,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44266:13"/>yea, and almoſt impoſſible in a Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> unleſs it be a little heat and paſſion with his ſervants, which tends nevertheleſs to their advantage, becauſe he has no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been rough with them, but that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rewards them; which makes men ſay, that it is more pleaſure to be chid by Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> than to be praiſed and careſſed by him. He was not well ſatisfied, as we have already ſaid, about the end of the Conclave, at the choice that was made of Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> and he had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, but upon thoughts of making the Pope change that ſentiment, by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit that he promiſed himſelf upon his mind: but ſo ſoon, as from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he perceived himſelf very far wide of his project, that the Pope was wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the new Nephew, that himſelf had much adoe to get to ſpeak to him with all the dependance and grimaces, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to make, and many other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, that barred him from his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confidence: he applyed himſelf to the digging of a Mine (if I may ſay ſo) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to blow up the Cardinal Regnant, and that he might undermine the foundation of his ſettlement, he made uſe of Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> to whom the fortune of <hi>Paluzzi,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44266:13"/>was more inſupportable, than to any other of the Colledge.</p>
               <p>This Cardinal was the Popes kinſman, and by conſequence, might pretend to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nephew, with better right than <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzzi:</hi> the Pope would not have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have given him a good ſhare in the Government; and if he had been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Conclave, poſſibly he would have preferred him to any other: but he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> upon the conſideration of <hi>Chigi</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and <hi>Paluzzi</hi> could not admit of a companion to ſhare with him in the Sovereign Authority.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> in one of his firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences told the Pope, that he was as much concerned in the glory of his Papacy, as he had been active in his Election: that he approved the choice his Holineſs had made of Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi;</hi> but that that ought to be no prejudice to thoſe, who by Blood were more cloſely linked to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: that without being obliged to raiſe new creatures, his Holineſs had in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> capable of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both by his age, and his conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted experience, and more inclined to the intereſts of the houſe of <hi>Altieri,</hi> upon the account of Blood, than others upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Favour; that the ſame Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44266:14"/>being already in pretty good condition by his management and good Husbandry, would have leſs need to laviſh the Revenues of the Church for maintaining of his rank, and doing credit to the Holy See; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs all the principal Charges of the Holy See and Palace, were already beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on others, and no ſhare given to him; that the Office of Datary, as well as that of Secretary of State were given away; that the Cardinal had great cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but that his moderation and reſpect made him ſtifle his grievances; that the whole Court found fault with it, that it was not his mind to perſwade his Holineſs to retract what he had already wiſely done; that they who poſſeſſed the places which he had conferred, worthily diſcharged them; but that in his opinion, his Holineſs had means ſtill left of contenting <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring others, to wit, by giving him a place near him in the Palace; that that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance would defend his Honour, which ran hazard by ſo diſadvantageous an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a removal from all charges.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſeemed not averſe from the ſentiments of Cardinal <hi>Barbarini;</hi> and as to that, that he had as yet done nothing for Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> he let him know, that he ſhould not want means and occaſions, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44266:14"/>make appear the eſteem which he had for his perſon; that it behoved him in the firſt place to mind thoſe, who were moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that the Offices of Datary and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, were places of too much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and fatigue for one of his age, and even in ſome manner below his merit; that as to the Miniſtery of Nephew, he neither could, nor ought to have done otherwayes, for reaſons that were very well known: that in a word, it behoved him ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean himſelf, that he might give no ground of Jealouſie in his Family; and that he hoped his eminence would not a little contribute to the preſerving of peace therein.</p>
               <p>After this Anſwer, which was general enough, Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> acquainted <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brieli,</hi> that with a little aſſiduity in making his Court, he might obtain what he would of the Pope; that it behoved him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and be ſeen in the Palace, and that as being a Kinſman he ſhould paſs over the Formalities of depending on thoſe of the Chamber for acceſs to his Holineſs. In this manner he carried himſelf for ſome dayes, and oftner than Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; but with much conſtraint, becauſe hardly could he ever ſpeak to the Pope alone, being beſet by Cardinal <hi>Altieri.</hi> He
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44266:15"/>complained of this to Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> who preſently found out an expedient to free him of the preſence of <hi>Altieri.</hi> He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> that for the future, both of them ſhould go to the Palace at the ſame houre: that being there, whilſt <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eli</hi> ſhould entertain the Pope, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire audience of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe buſineſs to him that ſhould keep them long enough in diſcourſe together, that ſo <hi>Gabrieli</hi> might have time to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Pope all he intended to ſay, without being interrupted or hindered by the jealouſie of <hi>Altieri.</hi> This was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral times, not without ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts: and that <hi>Gabrieli</hi> might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Plot, <hi>Barbarini</hi> and <hi>Gabrieli</hi> made uſe alſo of other Cardinals and Prelates, their Friends, to carry on the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue on ſeveral occaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gabrieli</hi> had already gained a great deal upon the Inclinations of the Pope, who told him, that he would call him to the Palace to entruſt him as well as <hi>Altieri</hi> with the care of the Papacy.</p>
               <p>It was enough for <hi>Barbarini,</hi> that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brieli</hi> had footing in the Palace: and that being once granted him, like a new <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> he would have moved the whole Earth.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44266:15"/>
               <p>But Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> having diſcovered the Plot; whether that the Pope had impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him his intentions for <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> or that he was Jealous of the Conferences and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent audiences that the Pope gave to that Competitor; he could not but at length appear in his colours; and having, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devices, rendered the Audiences of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brieli</hi> leſs frequent, ſo as to have made him one day wait ſome hours before he could be admitted; when <hi>Gabrieli</hi> complained of it, he told him, that he did indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe the Popes goodneſs, that his old age ought to be otherwayes dealt with, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by him, who ſhould be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that than any body elſe, as being his Kinſman and Friend; that when his Holineſs called for him, he ſhould be the firſt to give him notice of it, that he would do beſt to ſpare the Popes caſe and his own trouble; with many other Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that ſufficiently diſcovered his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. <hi>Gabrieli</hi> found himſelf obliged by this, either to make a ſhameful retreat, or down-right to fall out with the Nephew Regnant: becauſe the good Pope was ſtill of his old humour, to receive Impreſſions alwayes from him that diſcourſed him laſt, and in that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> had alwayes the advantage.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44266:16"/>
               <p>He repreſented to his Holyneſs, that if he brought <hi>Gabrieli</hi> into the Palace, he would be no longer Maſter at home; that he muſt make his Accompts, that <hi>Gabrieli</hi> having footing there, <hi>Barbarini</hi> would be the moving Wheel of all his Actions; and that ſo in ſtead of one, he would have two Maſters, which would render his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate doubly odious: <hi>Barbarini,</hi> by the averſion which Men of Merit had towards him; and, <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> by his ſordid avarice, even to the ſmalleſt matters; that though both of them were Men of excellent parts, yet theſe qualities had alwayes kept them from being choſen Popes.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and ſuch like ſuggeſtions, put the good old man into an indifferency for his Kinſman; and withal, he conſidered, that if he conferred his Favours on <hi>Gabrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> he muſt leſſen ſomewhat of thoſe which he deſigned for <hi>Altieri;</hi> and his Brother, who had taken the ſame Name and Armes, and whom, by conſequent, he was more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to advance; becauſe with <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> who was already old, his Liberalities would ſoon periſh, when on the other hand they would continue long in memory with <hi>Paluz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, the adopted Nephew ſo won upon the Unckle, that he made known
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44266:16"/>to <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> that it was his intention he ſhould let him live in repoſe; that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, when occaſion offered, he ſhould not forget, by real and ſatisfactory Markes, to let him know the eſteem he had of his Friendſhip, and Merit, and that he was mindful of the Relation that was betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gabrieli</hi> therefore is now in the Field, not with a purpoſe to retreat, but to give his Enemy open Battel. He goes to the Palace, highly complains that Promiſes are broken to him in a matter that tended to nothing elſe, but to teſtifie his zeal for the Perſon of the Pope; that Cardinal <hi>Paluz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi> has no right to render himſelf abſolute Maſter of one to whom he has no relation; that he himſelf will take the care of his preſervation; that that man ought to be diſtruſted, who has no other intereſt in his Holineſs, but what is obtained by a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Cabal, and who both by Birth and Humour ſignifies but little: he huffs, and ſtormes, alarmes the whole Palace, and will needs ſpeak to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the effects of this firſt heat; In the mean time Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but wiſely gave him leiſure to ſpit his fire. His Holineſs gave him audience, and after a ſhort diſcourſe diſmiſſed him with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44266:17"/>theſe words, That he ſhould e're long be contented.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Gabrieli</hi> diſcourſed <hi>Barbarini,</hi> who demanded an extraordinary Audience of the Pope, to make his laſt attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in favour of his Friend. He told his Holineſs, that he was troubled at the bad intelligence that was between <hi>Gabrieli</hi> and <hi>Altieri,</hi> and at the grounds of diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that were given to the former; that he well foreſaw, that by the ſmall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he received from <hi>Altieri,</hi> he would be neceſſitated to theſe reſentments; that if the content which he deſired, of being received near his Holineſs, as himſelf had propoſed, had been granted him, matters would not have been as they were; that he was not come to beg any new thing of his Holineſs, but rather that he would think on ſome means to appeaſe irritated minds, and to reconcile them, as well for avoiding of publick ſcandal, as for the quiet of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the good of his Kindred; that to be ſhort, it was diſhonourable for both parties, that Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli</hi> ſhould quit his pretenſions without ſome advantageous pretext.</p>
               <p>The Pope, naturally of a calme temper, prayed Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> to adviſe him how he might maintain Peace in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44266:17"/>and made him Umpire in that Difference, with this Reſervation onely, that he would not think more of eſtabliſhing <hi>Gabrieli</hi> in the Palace, becauſe it would be the way to bring in continual Jealouſies and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between him and <hi>Altieri,</hi> under his very Noſe; that he would have been very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have had him near him, but that it behoved him for a greater good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf of that ſatisfaction; and that it was eaſie to be ſeen what might be feared from his ſettlement in the Palace, ſeeing the Umbrage of ſome Conferences and Audiences that he had given him, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many diſorders and changes in Mens Minds; that it was impoſſible to divide the Miniſtery betwixt two of ſo diſunited Sentiments, who had broken out in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ruptures; that in fine, it behoved him to think of ſome honeſt means of uniting them, and that there was no man that could better compoſe the matter than Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>By this diſcourſe of the Pope, <hi>Barbarini</hi> found himſelf indiſpenſably obliged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a thing to which he had great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, becauſe the removing of <hi>Gabrieli</hi> under never ſo ſpecious a pretext, would be the cutting of the principal Thread of the Plot, which himſelf had ſpun; he knew
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44266:18"/>that he would thereby loſe all the part in Affairs, which he promiſed himſelf by the good intelligence that was betwixt them; That <hi>Altieri</hi> would never put any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, becauſe he was obliged to <hi>Chigi</hi> for his fortune. On the other hand, it was to no purpoſe to raiſe more broyles, and that that would do no good, ſeeing he had left the Pope in a reſolution of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Gabrieli</hi> upon ſome honeſt pretext.</p>
               <p>He ſet to work therefore in good earneſt to order affaires to the ſatisfaction of his Holineſs and the Nephew Regnant, with as much advantage as he could for his friend <hi>Gabrieli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After many Propoſitions on either ſide, it was at length ſo brought about, that <hi>Gabrieli</hi> was ſatisfied with the Legation of <hi>Romania,</hi> and a conſiderable Penſion, with other higher appointments than were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given to the Legats of that Province: Thus he yielded to the preſent neceſſity of ſubmitting to the ſtronger, and changed his Project of Reigning into that of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable retreat; leaving <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Altieri,</hi> as the Emperors in the laſt Ages of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire left it to the Popes, he choſe <hi>Ravenna</hi> for the place of his Reſidence, where the ſame Emperours had eſtabliſhed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Seat of the Hexarchat.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44266:18"/>
               <p>This was the ſucceſs of that Intrigue, which ſerved onely to fix <hi>Altieri</hi> more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſaddle, having removed from his eyes the onely perſon that could croſs him in his deſigns; made manifeſt the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to maintain him, and taken from all others the hopes of making any attempt to his prejudice for the future.</p>
               <p>So that it may be ſaid, that fortune, which commonly takes no great care of its own workes, changed its inclination in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Altieri;</hi> for had ſhe oppoſed to him any one that had had another ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, another conduct, or other qualities than Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> he would have found himſelf not a little hampered.</p>
               <p>He had no other Protector but Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> and it was known at Court that <hi>Barbarini</hi> backt him more for his own intereſt, that he might have a Man at his devotion about the Pope, than for any conſideration of his Merit. And, ſeeing the Government of <hi>Barbarini</hi> was alwayes dreaded, there was no great intereſt at Court uſed for <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> who, beſides that, had never in his life-time acquired many Friends or Creatures.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44266:19"/>
               <p>As to the conduct that he followed; either he ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> the Pope, in progreſs of time, would, of himſelf made reflexion on a Kinſman, either from the tenderneſs of blood, or by the ſuggeſtion of ſome third perſon; or he would at leaſt have attracted the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal compaſſion of the Court and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and turned againſt <hi>Altieri</hi> all the Shafts of publick indignation. Thus he might have taken the advantage of ſome conjuncture to mount the Throne, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might have happened in the late differences of the Colledge of Cardinals, and the Miniſters of Crowns with <hi>Altieri;</hi> whereas in quitting his pretenſions, he loſt all, and brought himſelf into no eſteem.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Intrigues of Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi Altieri</hi> for the alliances of his Houſe with many Illuſtrious Families of <hi>Rome,</hi> and chiefly the Intrigue of the Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> as has been ſaid in the preceeding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, was raiſed to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nephew, and was more abſolute than any that went before him in the Soveraignty of Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And, although the foundation of that fortune was in ſome ſort weaker than of that of other Nephews, yet the old age and temper of the Pope rendered him more abſolutely the Maſter to diſpoſe of all things, than any of thoſe that had preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in that quality.</p>
               <p>The firſt Project he propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was, to raiſe his family by Alliances; and, in the flouriſhing ſtate of ſo eminent grandeur, it was no hard matter for him to find out very advantageous means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44266:20"/>
               <p>There are many noble and rich Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Rome,</hi> who court the Alliances of the Families of the Popes Regnant, ſince now they have no other way to maintain their grandeur; and though the authority and command which they enjoy by ſuch Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be confined to the Popes Life, yet they have the comfort after his death of the quality of Princes, which remains to them, with the other advantages of Eſtates that they have purchaſed during the time of his Reign.</p>
               <p>The houſe of the Prince of <hi>Carbognano</hi> was equally conſiderable in Nobility, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief branch of the family of <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and in richneſs, being much encreaſed by the good husbandry of the Prince of that Name, who then lived.</p>
               <p>There were but two Sons in that houſe, the elder called the Duke of <hi>Baſſanello;</hi> and the younger named <hi>D. Egidio</hi> Duke of <hi>Anticoli.</hi> The firſt was Married to the Siſter of the Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> the faireſt and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Princeſs in <hi>Rome;</hi> and poſſibly in all <hi>Italy;</hi> but without hopes of having Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. So that the whole Eſtate that was to fall to the younger, made him be looked upon as the richeſt Match in <hi>Rome.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri</hi> caſt his eyes upon him, and cauſed a Match to be propoſed to him with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44266:21"/>a Grand Neece of the Pope, and all the advantages that he might thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Carbognano</hi> liſtened to the propoſition, and was ready to give his conſent to it; but the elder, who perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by that Match, his younger Brother would be advanced to a higher quality then himſelf, did all he could to croſs it; he imployed his Brother-in-Law the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and his other Relations, to divert his Father and Brother from that Deſign. They repreſented to them, that there was no great advantage to be expected from the Alliance of an Aged Pope, ſuch as <hi>Clement</hi> X. that they ought not to relye on a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, whoſe Fortune was in continual danger, being onely founded on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an Old Man, capable of all ſorts of Impreſſions. That there was little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be gained with a Man of ſuch a condition, and of a far baſer humour, who converted every thing into Bartering and Traffick: That it would be a fine ſight to ſee him to day on the Throne, and three dayes after grovelling in the duſt, either by the fall of the Nephew, or the death of the Unckle.</p>
               <p>Theſe Suggeſtions and Conſiderations did not at all ſhake the Prince of <hi>Carbog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44266:21"/>in his Deſign: his younger Son was already old enough to think of Marrying; the Father was ſo old, as, in probability he ought not to expect another Pontificat, to ſee Succeſſors of his Name, his Family, and the great Eſtate that he had acquired with ſo much care and frugality.</p>
               <p>He treated with Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that his Son might have the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Princes, which are called <hi>del Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> or of the Throne: he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> to grant him the ſame honour for his eldeſt Son, that ſo he might pleaſe him: but becauſe that drew after it great conſequences, they gave him good words, with hopes of overcoming the difficulties that at firſt appeared in that Propoſition; that it behoved him firſt to gain the Pope, by ſhewing a readineſs to embrace the occaſion that offered of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Family, and that afterward he might promiſe himſelf any thing of his goodneſs.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs being brought to theſe termes, the Marriage was quickly conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the new Married perſons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented by all the Court, acknowledged and treated as the Popes Nephews. But, ſome time after, the rejoycing of that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44266:22"/>Marriage was interrupted, by the diſquiet of the Duke of <hi>Baſſanello.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaw the Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> his Brother, in great grandeur treated as the Popes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, with all the Priviledges that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that quality. There was no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Engagement of putting him in poſſeſſion of the ſame honours, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the marriage of his Holineſſes Neece with his Brother. He complained highly of it daily, and had no other ſatisfaction but ambiguous anſwers, or the teſtimonies of good intentions, which produced a delay as bad as a refuſal.</p>
               <p>So that being wearied by ſo many unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable purſuits, when he found there was nothing for him to expect, and that he was told his pretenſion could not ſucceed; that it could not be brought into practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no example for it; that it would introduce a too inſupportable abuſe into the Court, of calling to the degrees of the Throne, not onely the Popes Kindred, but alſo all thoſe that were related to them; that ſo the Chappels and intire Halls would not ſuffice to receive them: he quite fell out with Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> his Brother the Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> and the Ducheſs his Siſter in Law.</p>
               <p>Having continued ſome time in an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44266:22"/>which ſufficiently ſpake his ſecret indignation, he bethought himſelf of means to revenge himſelf of the pretended wrong that was done him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Nation, in general, is very diſcreet, and not eaſie to give offence, but is likewiſe very ſtiff, and almoſt inflexible to pardon an injury. Being a Politick and wiſe People, they think, that the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in forgetting a wrong, makes way for receiving another, becauſe Impunity makes men bold: when on the other hand, ſay they, if any one think, that if he offend me, I will never pardon him; he will have more care not to vex me.</p>
               <p>But, it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that there is great difference in the wayes of revenge, which are taken in ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> In <hi>Lombardie</hi> reſentments commonly break out to the higheſt exceſs; and there are few offences that are not followed by ſome Murder: And the worſt of all is, that he who hath done the wrong, does all he can to diſpatch him whom he thinks he has offended, that ſo he may prevent him, being fully perſwaded that he cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape his reſentment.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Naples,</hi> Revenge is executed by Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of all ſorts, and they often fight on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44266:23"/>horſeback four againſt four, and ſo decide their controverſies.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſorts of revenge cannot be practiſed at <hi>Rome;</hi> the one, becauſe of the rigour of the Juſtice; the great Policy; and the numerous and ſtrong Guards in all the quarters of the Town: the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Eccleſiaſtick Laws, and that it is a Republick, which may be as truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>populus ſacerdotum,</hi> as <hi>Florus</hi> named it <hi>populus vivorum,</hi> in the beginning of its eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. There are none there but Prieſts or Clerks, or men belonging to Prieſts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom, by conſequent, one cannot draw a Sword.</p>
               <p>So that, ſaving ſome Placards and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinades, all revenge at <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſts in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, either by ruining, or croſſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of an Enemy with Law Suites, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, wherein the People of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are very ingenious, as well as in other places of the World.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Baſſanello</hi> had a means in his hands whereby to revenge himſelf of Cardinal <hi>Altieri;</hi> he knew that his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence had courted the alliance of his houſe, by reaſon of the great eſtate that muſt one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44266:23"/>day fall to his Brothers children, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being out of hopes of having any; he thought he could not more ſenſibly touch <hi>Altieri</hi> after the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> than to deprive him of his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as much as the Law would permit. And although that could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a troubleſome blow to his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by diſinheriting his onely Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> yet the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he took in revenge was ſo ſweet, that it ſtifled all the conſiderations of his own blood.</p>
               <p>He had a good Eſtate that he could alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and eſpecially the beſt part of the inheritance of the late Prince of <hi>Gallicano,</hi> who left it him at his death, and was worth about Two thouſand five hundred pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> a year. Nevertheleſs he would not have that Eſtate go out of the Family and Name of <hi>Colonna</hi>'s; he was not ſo blinded by paſſion as to do ſo. He caſt therefore his eyes upon the Duke of <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino,</hi> the younger Brother of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of his Lady, to whom he bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Eſtate that he could diſpoſe of, and which was not entailed on the Houſe of <hi>Carbognano.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:44266:24"/>
               <p>This Donation made in prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> and by conſequent of the alliance of <hi>Altieri,</hi> came quickly to the knowledge of the Cardinal Regnant, and there was no ſecrecy affected in a matter that was purpoſely done to choak him; which indeed gave him a mortal blow, and wounded him in the two moſt ſenſible parts of a Man, Honour and Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> is therefore offended, and, by the offence, obliged to a reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He hath the ſupreme power in his hands, and muſt think of the means; but, againſt whom will he teſtifie his reſentments? He hath no pretext againſt the Duke of <hi>Baſſanello,</hi> who is a Lord, that hath alwayes lived after the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, that is to ſay, who hath alwayes made it his buſineſs to live, and let live, as they uſually ſay, and hath never been capable of troubling the State; yea, one may preſume of his geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, that if he hath fallen on ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme reſolution, ſome body muſt have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him the thoughts.</p>
               <p>Therefore Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> bends his deſigns againſt the Houſe of the Conſtable; and, without any noiſe, finds the means of giving him the exchange, and of playing him as ſmart a trick as that which had been done to him.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44266:24"/>
               <p>And, becauſe that gives occaſion to the great and long Intrigue of the Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> which is at length concluded with D. <hi>Frederick Sforza;</hi> that I may not ſay to that Comedy, wherein all the Princes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and even the Miniſters of Crowned heads played ſome part, with ſo many changes on the Scene; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to trace the matter a little higher, that with leſs confuſion we may follow the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Story.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Ceſarini</hi> that died laſt, left a very conſiderable Eſtate to his Family, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Male iſſue, bequeathed the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Brother Mr. <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> then Clerk of the Apoſtolick Chamber. That Prelate made no difficulty of leaving all the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes of riſing to a Cardinalſhip, that he might embrace an inheritance ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as well by the fair Mannors and Lordſhips, as by the lovely Houſes and Palaces, and the Lands which amounted to more than Fifty thouſand Roman Crouns of yearly revenue, that make about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand pound Engliſh.</p>
               <p>But, that Lord, by the Debauchery of his youth, had ſo impaired his health, that he could not hope to leave after him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the Houſe of <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:44266:25"/>
               <p>This great Eſtate then was entail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children of the Daughters of Duke <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> with this condition, That they, whom they Married, ſhould eſpouſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>France;</hi> and adhere faithfully to the Intereſts of that Crown.</p>
               <p>That clauſe of the Teſtament ſhewed ſufficiently the temper of the Father, whom I knew to be ſo zealous for his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty, that he propoſed to me a little before his death, a deſign he had of exchanging his Mannours, Lordſhips, and Lands in <hi>Italy,</hi> with a Lord whom I need not name; and had appointed me to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the affaire, to the end that he might retire into <hi>France:</hi> I owe this digreſſion to the memory of a Prince, who had no other fault, but his too much zeal for the French Nation.</p>
               <p>He diſpoſed therefore of his Eſtate in favour of the children of his eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after the death of his Brother, in caſe he died without Male iſſue: he ordered likewiſe but a ſmall Portion for the reſt, to take them off from the thoughts of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that ſo his Eſtate might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt many branches.</p>
               <p>He had two at the age of Marrying, both living in a Convent with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and equally conſiderable by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44266:25"/>of birth and beauty; but unlike as to Portion and Eſtate, becauſe the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt was heireſs preſumptive General of the Mannors, Lordſhips, and Palaces of his Family.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Sonino,</hi> the Conſtables Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who before was called the Abbot <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> forſook the Eccleſiaſtick State, that he might Marry the younger Siſter; but on condition that the elder would become Nun, and renounce the pretenſions, and rights of her birth-right, which was done with conſent of the Unckle. This elder Siſter, either through the perſwaſions of her Unckle, or becauſe ſhe was nor at that time in an humour of Marrying, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to all that was agreed upon between the Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> her Unckle, and the Prince of <hi>Sonino</hi> her Brother-in-Law; but, no Articles were drawn upon that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all depended upon the faithfulneſs of a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> to play a trick to the Houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> like to that which the Houſe of <hi>Colonna</hi> had played him, by the Donation of the Duke of <hi>Baſſanello</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Sonino,</hi> took his meaſures ſo well, that he deprived the Duke of <hi>Sonino</hi> of the pretended inheritance of the houſe of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarini,</hi> by putting the eldeſt <hi>Ceſarini</hi> in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44266:26"/>Head to Marry, notwithſtanding her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in favours of her younger Siſter.</p>
               <p>For that effect, he ſet many at work, to manage the young Lady, and gain upon her Mind. It was no hard matter for Churchmen to break a young Maid off the thoughts of a Cloyſter, and for Spiritual Superiours to make her change her deſign, as well by the dependence on their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as to the kind of life which ſhe led, as by the tenderneſs of an age ſuſceptible of all the impreſſions that were made upon it.</p>
               <p>When her mind was wrought upon in the Convent, where ſhe had choſen her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> made known to her, that his Holineſs would take her into his Protection, and that he deſired to Marry her with all the advantage due unto her birth and merit.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſhe had not declared her ſelf in favour of any, having had no converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Man, ſhe was ſhewed Don <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Sforza,</hi> Nephew to the Cardinal, and Son to Don <hi>Paolo Sforza,</hi> whoſe Houſe is more remarkable, by the Antiquity of its Nobility, than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of eſtate. This young Man was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſome; and it was an eaſie matter for him to make a Conqueſt of a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44266:26"/>heart, which was in the hands of thoſe who had introduced him to her.</p>
               <p>This Intrigue was not managed with ſo much ſecreſie, but that the Conſtable had quickly notice of it; he complained to Duke <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> that they diſcourſed in the Palace of marrying his Neece; that he knew very well that ſuch a thing went againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made upon the marriage contracted between his younger Neece, and the Duke of <hi>Sonino</hi> his Brother; which was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but upon condition of the renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Elder. What injury would it be, both to the Honor and Eſtate of his Houſe! that the Duke of <hi>Sonino</hi> had three Sons that would be miſerable, if ſuch a marriage took effect; that it behoved him to apply himſelf in good earneſt toward that blow: that it was in the power of an Uncle, who was in place of a Father, to hinder his Necce from marrying, that as to himſelf, he would rather periſh with all his Family, than ſuffer that wrong and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> promiſed the Conſtable, to do all he could to hinder it: that he would never conſent to it, but that he muſt aſſiſt him on his part to gain the Lady, that they needed not deſpair to make her quite a deſigne, which ſhe had only concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44266:27"/>at the ſolicitation of thoſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, who ſought not ſo much her good, as the occaſion of revenge, even to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her conſcience, her repoſe, and the ſettlement of her Family; that moreover, he ought to endeavour to make the Mother, who would have great influence upon her mind, becauſe ſhe lived with her.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable and Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> having leagued with the Mother (who at firſt they won to their ſide) uſed all poſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to take off the young Lady from the thoughts of marriage. But finding all their attempts unprofitable, and that in vain they had ſucceſſively uſed Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Prayers, and Threatnings, becauſe ſhe relyed upon the Supream Authority; they betook themſelves to other Artifices.</p>
               <p>They thought that without further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her deſigne of Marriage, it behoved them to propoſe to her another Match, in appearance more advantageous, than D. <hi>Frederick Sforza:</hi> that they muſt needs find out one, whom Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to the end, that if ſhe conſented to it againſt the Will of his Eminence, the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age might break off, and ſo ſhe remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having either the one or other; but that was not enough, the party muſt likewiſe be ſuch, that if the Marriage ſhould ſucceed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44266:27"/>contrary to their intention, as it might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well do, the houſe of <hi>Altieri</hi> might find a diſadvantage thereby, as well as that of the Conſtable, that ſo they might be even with him.</p>
               <p>All theſe conditions concurred in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of D. <hi>Celio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Bracciano,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini.</hi> And the better to rip up the matter, we muſt here digreſs to an alliance, that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> made with the Family of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> ſo ſoon as he was adopted Nephew to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> that diſputes the precedency with all the Families of <hi>Rome,</hi> Noble by its original, by its antiquity, by its alliances, and by its dignities and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is divided into two branches, whereof the chief is at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the head of it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Duke of <hi>Bracciano,</hi> the other is at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the head whereof takes the name of Duke of <hi>Gravina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſted in the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom we have named, to wit, the Duke of <hi>Bracciano,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> and D. <hi>Lelio;</hi> and was almoſt extinct: the Duke of <hi>Bracciano</hi> being aged, and without children; the ſecond a Prieſt; and the third of ſuch a Devotion as did degenerate into a kind of weakneſs, and all three of a ſickly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44266:28"/>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> whoſe care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of making his Family, is hardly to be matched, no more than his fortune; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that all the Eſtate of the Roman <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> was about to deſcend to thoſe of the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> applied himſelf from the beginning of his Reign, to draw them into an alliance with his Family: he cauſed a marriage of a Neece of the Pope, to be propoſed to the Duke of <hi>Gravina,</hi> with a vaſt ſum of money in portion, and a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat for a Brother of that Duke, who was then a Jacobin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gravina</hi> needed no great entreatie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that Match, being allured to it by the advantage of holding the rank of one of the Popes Nephews at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the hope of enjoying the inheritance of the Roman <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> himſelf, as being much young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than all of them were: the marriage was concluded then to the ſatisfaction of all that were concerned in it, and the married par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties taſted the joys of a calm Serenity, crowned with honors, amidſt far greater hopes.</p>
               <p>But the Intrigue of the Conſtable, and Duke of <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> who pitched upon D. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> to be propoſed in marriage to the elder <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> troubled the contentment of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44266:28"/>
                  <hi>Gravina,</hi> as well as of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> and his Relations.</p>
               <p>They ſaw that the expectation of the great Eſtates of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> was in danger to be diſappointed by that marriage; and although D. <hi>Lelio</hi> was already well ſtricken in years, conſidering the age of the young Lady, yet he was not out of hopes of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving children; they had a near inſtance of it in the houſe of the <hi>Mathei;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Acqua Sparta,</hi> at the age of Sixty nine years, having had a Son by a very young Lady.</p>
               <p>It was no difficult matter for the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> to gain the Lady to conſent to that match, and to leave the thoughts of D. <hi>Frederick Sforza;</hi> by that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance ſhe found her ſelf the ſole Heireſs of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini;</hi> beſides that, it agreed better with the inclination of her Mother and Uncle. It was likewiſe repreſented to her, that one eſſential clauſe of the Teſtament of the Duke of <hi>Ceſarini</hi> her Father was, That in caſe his Daughters ſhould marry, thoſe whom they choſe for Husbands ſhould be approved of by his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; that this condition was not to be found in the Family of the <hi>Sforza's,</hi> ſeeing the Cardinal of that name, Uncle to D. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> was of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> had always been,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44266:29"/>time out of mind, addicted to the <hi>French</hi> party, and that the Cardinal, the Brother of D. <hi>Lelio</hi> was actually the Comprotector of the affairs of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>She condeſcended then to that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, waving the conſideration of the age of D. <hi>Lelio:</hi> but that innocent Victime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not that both parties deſigned to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her to Intereſt and Revenge, the cruelleſt of Deities, which all the bloud in the world can neither content nor appeaſe. The two parties played their game with her, and ſhe knew nothing of it: nevertheleſs ſhe had taken the better courſe, to have followed the propoſitions of Cardinal <hi>Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> whatever his intentions were, than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the party offered by the Conſtable; becauſe the firſt intended at laſt to give her a Husband, and make her the Miſtriſs of her own Eſtate, only that he might be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Conſtable and his Family, and the other, by revenging himſelf on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> revenged himſelf likewiſe on her, by propoſing a marriage to her, which he judged could not take effect, and of the ſucceſs whereof himſelf was afraid, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no other advantage of that propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of D. <hi>Lelio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> than to ſet her at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> or to tire out his Eminence: ſeeing it was equally hurtful
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44266:29"/>to the Duke of <hi>Somino,</hi> whether ſhe marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sforza</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini;</hi> and that he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no other ſatisfaction by her marriage with the latter, but to mortifie the Duke of <hi>Gravina,</hi> and by conſequence <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Lady <hi>Ceſarini</hi> was not the only perſon that was impoſed upon by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: D. <hi>Lelio</hi> himſelf was alſo abuſed: He ſet to work in good earneſt to marry a Wife; and the great Piety whereof he made profeſſion, was not inconſiſtent with the ſentiments of an honeſt and virtuous love.</p>
               <p>In this condition D. <hi>Lelio</hi> made his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> as punctually as it can be made to an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady, ſhut up in a Nunnery. D. <hi>Frederick Sforza</hi> had not the ſame advantage, becauſe the Mother, who was made for D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> found means to keep the one at diſtance, and to admit the other.</p>
               <p>When that affair came at firſt to the knowledge of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> he made no great matter of it; he perceived very well, they intended to play him a trick, but he could not be perſwaded (as the truth indeed was) that the Conſtable had a real deſigne to bring that Marriage to effect, which was equally fatal to his own Houſe, as to the Family of <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44266:30"/>
               <p>He knew likewiſe, that they had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the young Lady to change her mind, but that put him at no variance with her, and he well perceived that to be rather an effect of her complaiſance and obedience, than of her inclination: that it would be eaſie for him ſtill to reclaim her; her new Gallant D. <hi>Lelio</hi> being no ſuch charming Blade, as that a young Maid would forſake all other objects for him; and eſpecially D. <hi>Frederick</hi> who was a far more ſutable Match.</p>
               <p>He failed not however ſtill to tamper with the Lady; he talked before her, of the propoſition of D. <hi>Lelio</hi> as ridiculous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his qualities; adding, that it was an odious proffer, ſeeing the Authors of it would only impoſe upon her, it being the leaſt in their thoughts to have her married. In the mean time he adviſed her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mble, but ſtill to remain conſtant, ſeeing ſhe was aſſured of the Protection and good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Holy Father.</p>
               <p>When the Conſtable found that matters went not in the rode that he had propoſed; that the faculty of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> in liſtening to the Match of D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> had put no miſunderſtanding betwixt her and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who perſiſted ſtill to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in the humor of Marrying, and that they correſponded together as formerly:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44266:30"/>he grew apprehenſive, and juſtly too, that the propoſed Marriage might be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated when he ſhould leaſt expect; which without any other formalities, might be done at every inſtant; becauſe the Pope is above all, and Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> had Force joyned to the Soveraign Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In effect, he muſt have given over at laſt; and the the thing had been preſently put in execution, if he had not ſtarted a difficulty, which ſtopt the concluſion of the affair.</p>
               <p>He brought upon the ſtage the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>France,</hi> with whom he lived in very good intelligence, as he hath always done with the Lords and Ambaſſadors of that Nation, notwithſtanding the reluctancy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom he is obliged to obſerve his meaſures, becauſe of his States and his quality, of Conſtable of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He eaſily engaged the Ambaſſador in his deſigne, who then was the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees,</hi> already diſſatisfied with Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> as we ſhall ſee in the Intrigue of the Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon;</hi> they reſolved to let <hi>Altieri</hi> know, that the Lady <hi>Ceſarini</hi> was under the protection of the King, by order, even of the laſt Will of the late Duke her Father: that by the Teſtament of the ſame Duke, his Daughters could not marry
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44266:31"/>without the approbation of his Majeſty: that the <hi>Sforza's</hi> were addicted to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Intereſts, and that by conſequence, the King would never approve of that Match, that the marriage propoſed with D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> was liked of by his Majeſty, becauſe that Houſe was actually in his ſervice, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and under his protection: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did oppoſe the Marriage propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Altieri,</hi> and that the match with D. <hi>Lelio</hi> muſt be concluded.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> made anſwer to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that he would never fail, in the reſpect due to his moſt Chriſtain Majeſty, which he did not think he injured by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the good intentions of the Pope, for the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> whoſe liberty was like to be oppreſſed by the injuſtice of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Colonna,</hi> who deſigned, by ſhutting her up, contrary to her inclinations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four Walls, to deprive her of her right to the Eſtate left by her Father to his children. That when his Majeſty ſhould underſtand the good intentions of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, he would not only praiſe, but thank his Holineſs for them, as well upon the account of his great natural equity, as of the Friendſhip and good Will that he had for the Lady.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44266:31"/>
               <p>That as to the difficulty that was ſtarted of the adherence of the Houſe of <hi>Sforza</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> be ſides that, Don. <hi>Paola Sforza,</hi> Father to D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> had always obſerved a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, ſuſpected rather to incline to <hi>Franco,</hi> than any other Nation; it would be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to remove that impediment, by making D. <hi>Fredrick</hi> declare for <hi>France,</hi> which was already endeavoured, and to which it was hoped they might obtain the approbation of his Majeſty; ſeeing it would engage a Noble Family to the <hi>French</hi> Faction, which in all appearance might exted to Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; whereas the Family of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> being already addicted to the Crown, no new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was made. That moreover, he had no thoughts of doing any thing, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Majeſty; and that in ſhort, he would leave it to the free option of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> to make what choice ſhe pleaſed.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer appeared moſt rational, but the Conſtable and his Brother the Duke of <hi>Sonino,</hi> could not reſt ſatisfied, becauſe, which way ſoever the matter went, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the marriage of the Lady <hi>Ceſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> that is to ſay, in the utter ruine of the Duke of <hi>Sonino,</hi> and of his children; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the oppoſition, which he made to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44266:32"/>marriage of D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> and the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of giving her Duke <hi>Lelio,</hi> his deſigne was to oblige Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> to let mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone as they were; to wit, the young Lady in the Nunnery, and the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino</hi> and his Lady, in the hopes of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>However, they gained ſomewhat by the intervention of the Ambaſſador: they might promiſe themſelves that no more would be done in the affair, without acquainting the French Miniſter; and that in the mean time they might have leiſure, either to perſwade the Lady to becaome Nun; or in caſe, ſhe would needs marry, to make her reſolve to accept of D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> which ſeemed to them the leſs prejudice, becauſe there was but ſmall appearance that he could leave any children after him of ſo unequal a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>They made therefore the beſt uſe of their time for attaining their ends, by prevailing with the French Ambaſſador to write to <hi>France,</hi> that he might obtain favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions as to the party he had eſpouſed, whilſt they on their ſide attacqued the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with all the Engines, which authority mingled with Artifice could imploy to gain her; but the Anſwers that came from <hi>France,</hi> were but very general, becauſe the <hi>S'forza's</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44266:32"/>on their ſide, ſollicited at Court, and were aſſiſted by their friends, for obtaining the approbation of the King: and beſides, the Lady was ſtill conſtant and immoveable in her reſolution of marrying.</p>
               <p>In ſo much that they could get no more of her, but an indifferency, at leaſt in words and appearance, for either of the two Matches, though if her heart had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, there would have been found there a formed Declartion in favour of Don. <hi>Frederick.</hi> But ſhe was willing to give her Mother and Uncle that ſatisfaction, to free here ſelf from their importunities as ſhe told Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> expecting till time ſhould bring a remedy to her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>That indifferency ſignified but little to the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s; but it was too much for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri;</hi> he feared that that ſtep might be followed by another, and he could not promiſe himſelf any thing of a Sex, that is as diſſembling as weak, which way ſoever that Maid bent her thoughts, having through the perſecutions of her Relations, forſaken D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> he found no ſatisfaction therein: if ſhe ſhould embrace the Nunnery and a Religious life, his contrived revenge would prove in vain: if ſhe declared her ſelf
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44266:33"/>for D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> the Inheritance of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> was ſnatched from his Family.</p>
               <p>In this diſquiet of thoughts, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> that ſhe ſhould have a ſpecial care of what ſhe did; that ſhe ſhould diſtruſt the perſwaſions of her Relations, as being acted by meer Intereſt; whereas his Holyneſs and himſelf, had no deſignes, but for her repoſe and advantage, that if the Holy Father ſhould come to know that ſhe failed in a ſutable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to his good intentions, as it ſeemed ſhe had, by becoming more ſlack in her good reſolution, he would abandon her to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of her Relations. She could not at that time forbear to complain of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of her Mother, Uncle, and of thoſe of their party; ſhe beſought Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri</hi> to aſſiſt her, and to think on means to rid her from the trouble wherein ſhe was; and from ſo many importunities wherewith ſhe was overwhelmed: that moreover ſhe continued ſtill in a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to depend abſolutely on his Holineſs, and his Eminence, who could not want means to overcome all the apparent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that had been ſtarted by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; that ſhe well perceived it to be an Artifice of the <hi>Colonna's;</hi> and which would take no effect,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44266:33"/>ſo ſoon as ſhe ſhould make her reaſons known to the King, with due ſubmiſſion both on the part of her ſelf, and of him who was deſigned for her Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Altieri</hi> was exceedingly well ſatisfied with that ſincere declaration; and that he might comply with what ſhe ſaid, as well as to make ſure of her Perſon; he gave Orders in his Holineſſes name, that none ſhould be admitted to ſpeak to her in the Nunnery without expreſs permiſſion from him.</p>
               <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s prohibition gave occaſion to her Relations, and to thoſe of the party of the <hi>Colonna's</hi> to clamour, and complain open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was contrary to the promiſe which <hi>Altieri</hi> had given, of leaving the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at liberty to make what choice ſhe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that they uſed violence towards her, and kept her ſhut up without ſpeaking to any body, that they might make her ſay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleaſed; and draw from her a forced conſent. This was not all, they engaged the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador in the quarrel, with threats, that if the Lady <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarini</hi> were not left in the ſame liberty as formerly, they would be obliged to repel force by force, and that they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her from the place where ſhe was, and put her into the hands of ſuch as might be able to anſwer for her.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:44266:34"/>
               <p>Theſe complaints were not carried t the Palace, but they made noiſe enough to come to the ears of Cardinal <hi>Altieri:</hi> He had no ſuſpicion of the Nuns of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, nor of thoſe that ſerved them abroad; the Pope is too abſolute over ſuch kind of perſons, and eſpecially at home, and under his Noſe; but he was afraid leſt the Mother of the Lady, who was of the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might by the intelligence of the <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's,</hi> and the aſſiſtance of the Ambaſſador, play him a trick.</p>
               <p>So that he cauſed the Lady to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Convent of <hi>St. Catherine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> ſeated on the Hill of <hi>Wagnanopoli,</hi> in ſight of the Palace of <hi>Montecavallo,</hi> to the content of <hi>St. Aure,</hi> beyond the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where Don. <hi>Frederick S'forza</hi> had an Aunt, and put guards upon her, with the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, to let none ſpeak with her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his expreſs permiſſion.</p>
               <p>This action made great noiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> though it was carried on with much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and dexterity, and to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini.</hi> The Mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that her Daughter was ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her embraces; Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> that his Neece was ſtolen; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that promiſe was not kept to him; D. <hi>Lelio,</hi> that his Miſtriſs was carried away;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44266:34"/>the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, that the moſt illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Rome,</hi> were uſed as ſlaves, and ſeeing the whole Intrigue was deviſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, their ſhare was likewiſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Cataſtrophe; they ſpared not to ſay, that they would all periſh firſt, rather than ſuffer, ſuch an injury and affront.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sforza's</hi> wiſely perceived that theſe menaces were directed to them; and that they were unequally matched with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi>'s; they took advice therefore of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> what they had beſt do, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void theſe conteſts with honor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Altieri</hi> adviſed D. <hi>Paolo Sforza,</hi> the Father of D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> and his Uncle the Cardinal, to ſend D. <hi>Frederick</hi> abroad for ſome time under pretext of travelling; and ſeeing the Italians begin their travels commonly by <hi>Germany,</hi> that they ſhould ſend him to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> and give him Orders to remain there, until new advice; that in the mean time they might have time to negotiate in <hi>France,</hi> for obtaining the Kings poſitive approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that they ſhould keep the affair dormant, and that by the removal of D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> the <hi>Colonna's</hi> would have no more cauſe of Umbrage, ſince they ſhould thereby make ſhew of mending the matter no more.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44266:35"/>
               <p>This counſel was followed, and had very good ſucceſs as to the <hi>Sforza's:</hi> they give it out, that D. <hi>Frederick</hi> in a deſperate fit of a Lover, who ſaw himſelf fruſtrated of the hopes of enjoying the ſole object of his his affections, was gone to <hi>Germany,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the wars, that by a generous death he might put an end to his torments and leave his Familie in repoſe: they pretended to complain of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who had been the cauſe of the loſs of that young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and who had only embarked him for his ruine.</p>
               <p>On that ſide matters went very well; but ſtill Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſtood in need of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon faithful to his Intereſts, to make ſure now more than ever of the perſeverance of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini.</hi> D. <hi>Frederick</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and as the <hi>Italians</hi> ſay, <hi>Lontano da glocchi, lontano dal cuore,</hi> Far from the eyes far from the heart: The Pope could not refuſe Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> the liberty to ſend to ſee his Neece, becauſe he always kept his Chamber or Bed, lame and unable to move, through the Gout and Catharres.</p>
               <p>So that there was need of a faithful Trucheman, to entertain the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:44266:35"/>
               <p>No man was ſo fit for that, as Mr. <hi>Altoviti.</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> he was a Prelate of integrity and much experience in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Court; he had the direction and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence of the Convent of <hi>St. Anne,</hi> and of ſeveral others in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides intirely at the diſpoſal of thoſe of the Palace, ſo that neither could others doubt of his fidelity, nor the adverſaries take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at his Negotiations, which were to paſs for aſſiſtances of the Convent, to which his charge engaged him.</p>
               <p>And thus for a long time matters were carried on without noiſe; all things ſeemed to be ſtifled, and that the marriage of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini</hi> was one of thoſe very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Romances, which bring the Lover at length to ſeek for death to cure his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; and the Lady to ſhut her ſelf up in a cloyſter, having loſt what ſhe loved in the world.</p>
               <p>But theſe appearances huſht not the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s; on the contrary, they grew very watchful to obſerve all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: they had intelligence enough in <hi>France</hi> to know all that the <hi>Sforza's</hi> did there, for obtaining the King's conſent to the marriage of D. <hi>Frederick;</hi> and began alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perceive their credit, becauſe the French Ambaſſador ſeemed not ſo much
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44266:36"/>concerned in the matter, as he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been, ſticking only in the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the Lady <hi>Ceſarini</hi> might be free in her choice of a Husband, that ſhould pleaſe his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome,</hi> (where one may ſay that Spies do Reign, as Men Reign by Spies,) there wanted not ſome to diſcover the Intrigue of Mr. <hi>Altoviti,</hi> with the <hi>Sforza's</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri;</hi> beſides, that the frequent comings and goings, and the aſſiduities of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, at the Convent of <hi>St. Anne,</hi> his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, and viſits to the <hi>Sforza's,</hi> were much ſuſpected by them. They were even told that D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſince his departure had been ſecretly introduced to the Lady <hi>Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini:</hi> ſome went further, and ſaid that there was no more wanting to the Marriage, but the conſummation, and that it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Altieri,</hi> with all the neceſſary diſpenſations on the part of the Pope.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colonna</hi>'s affected as much ſilence, as their adverſaries; they teſtified no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt Mr. <hi>Altoviti,</hi> they ſeemed inſenſible of all theſe Intrigues; but the greateſt calm is commonly followed by ſome furious ſtorme.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:44266:36"/>
               <p>There were but two perſons, that with the Intelligence of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> had the conduct of the affair; to wit the Aunt of D. <hi>Frederick,</hi> a Nun in the Convent of <hi>St. Anne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Altoviti,</hi> who was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of the ſame. Nothing could be done to the Nun; and it ſeemed, that even Mr. <hi>Altoviti</hi> ought to have been ſecured from any attempt by his character of <hi>Patriarch;</hi> his habit of a Prelate, and many other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that rendred him venerable, not to ſpeak of the expreſs Orders which he had from the Palace, for all that he did.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, one evening as that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late returning from <hi>St. Anne,</hi> paſſed over the <hi>Ponte ſixto,</hi> ſome men unknown diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Carabine ſhot at him through the back of his Coach, with ſo much juſtneſs, that they retired, believing that he could not but die before he went far; for he was indeed, ſhot behind in the neck, and the bullet came out ſide-ways under his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he called out for help, and cauſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried to the next houſe, which belonged to a friend of his, called <hi>Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri,</hi> he prepared himſelf for death, but the ſhot was not ſo dangerous; for in a few weeks he was cured.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:44266:37"/>
               <p>There were few that did not regret the miſchance of Mr. <hi>Altoviti,</hi> he received in crouds, the teſtimonies thereof from the greateſt part of the Court, and even from thoſe, who were moſt to be ſuſpected for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hand in that black action.</p>
               <p>A friend of mine at that time made a Latine Diſtick; which went through the hands of all the Court: and thus was it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Barbare! quid violas violento tingere tentas</l>
                  <l>Sanguine? quas tingi murice Roma dabat.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But the Authors of this crime were talked of with great reſerve. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> himſelf, againſt whom this blow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly rebounded, ſeemed not very eager in the ſearch of the offenders: perhaps he expected that they ſhould have diſcovered themſelves; and that fear, which betrays moſt part of criminals, would make them take ſome reſolution, from whence they might draw evidence: ſo that ſpies were ſet to obſerve what countenance men had in the Palaces of the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> if they were more upon their guard than uſually; if there was no talk of retiring under ſome pretext into the Countrey; and ſuch like things, which are ſignes of diſtruſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a guilty conſcience.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:44266:37"/>
               <p>Though the Conſtable, or his Brother, were upon better grounds ſuſpected, than any body elſe; and in manner the only perſons that were believed capable of ſuch an enterpriſe, through the paſſion which with ſome reaſon did animate them againſt thoſe, who endeavoured the ruine of the younger Brother, yet nothing appeared of it; and next morning after the action was committed, the Conſtable was ſeen at his windows beholding ſome young men, who after the uſual manner, were riding the great Horſe in his Court.</p>
               <p>Information was taken but very ſlowly for the diſcovery of the aſſaſſinats, without attacquing thoſe on whom fell the common ſuſpicion: whence it was eaſily concluded that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> would not engage any deeper with them; becauſe it would have drawn upon him too many enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and have occaſioned too much noiſe; beſides, it would have been in vain to have indicted them criminally, having no evidence to prove the manner of the action, nor what perſons had committed it.</p>
               <p>However, Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> triumphed in this, that his adverſaries were blamed and reproached by all men, for ſo unworthy an action, though no body durſt ſpeak freely,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44266:38"/>eſpecially, ſince it was known, that even in the Palace there was no great appearance of reſentment; yet people moved by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for a Prelate of that merit, or by the horror of ſuch an aſſaſſination, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an averſion for the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, who were believed to be the Authors thereof.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s were not vexed in their minds, that the action was believed to proceed from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> not daring to ſhew any publick reſentment, it rendred them the more formidable, they were not vexed that there adherents publiſhed through <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s were powerful Lords, that they were able enough to hold the Baſon to the Nephews Beard (that is there way of ſpeaking; <hi>tenere il bacile all a barba</hi>) that they could arm ſuch a number of men for their defence, and call them to <hi>Rome</hi> with a whiſtle, that they had the protection of Crowns, and many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Romiſh bravery.</p>
               <p>Though ſuch diſcourſes were ridiculous with thoſe that know what the power of a Pope is in his States, and of Princes, who are reckoned upon but as his Subjects, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now adays: yet ſtill they made ſome impreſſions on the minds of the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are alike inclinable to admire and to deſpiſe.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44266:38"/>
               <p>This made Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſend for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Troops of Horſe to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> under pretext of a Muſter; to the end he might awe the People, by letting them ſee, that the Pope, for all he is ſo peaceable a Prince, yet is never without Armed Men ready to obey the leaſt Signal. Some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that they were called to back ſome enterpriſe againſt the <hi>Collonna's;</hi> but it was more probable that theſe men were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Rome,</hi> to obſerve the countenance of the <hi>Collonna's,</hi> and to be ready to take ſome advantage upon them, if they had armed, or gone out of Town; ſince no new thing happening, ſome dayes after the Soldiers were ſent back to their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>And this was all the ſatisfaction that Mr. <hi>Altoviti</hi> had, for having ſacrifiſed himſelf to the Intrigues of the Palace; and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an action of ſo much noiſe. Some other Nephew of a Pope would not perhaps have ſtopt there; but it was enough for <hi>Altieri</hi> to gain the chief end which he propoſed to himſelf; and he thought it would ſufficiently humble the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> if he ſucceeded in the Marriage of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:44266:39"/>
               <p>The <hi>Colonna's</hi> and <hi>Sforza's</hi> laboured to gain the French Ambaſſadour, and the Duke <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> the one to hinder, and the others to get the Marriage concluded in their favours; for <hi>D. Lelio</hi> appeared no more upon the Stage, and that point Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri</hi> had already gained; but the <hi>Sforza's</hi> had this advantage beſides upon the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> that the young Lady had an inclination for <hi>D. Frederick:</hi> that the French Ambaſſadour gave them good words, and bid them make friends at Court for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Kings approbation, and that he would not oppoſe it. He did the ſame with the <hi>Colonna's</hi> which put Duke <hi>Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> to that paſs, that he knew not what to do: nor what ſide to take, being beſides moved by the ſighs of a Neece, though by his promiſe engaged to the <hi>Colonna's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he was one day complaining of the importunities that were made to him upon the account of that Marriage, and that it was an addition to the trouble he ſuffered of being alwayes ſick a Bed; a perſon of merry humour that was preſent told him: 'Yſaith, my Lord Duke, to make them all friends, I adviſe you to Marry, and to take a Lady, that has wit and induſtry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to give you a Child in Nine Months time. This he ſaid familiarly and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44266:39"/>becauſe Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> could not ſo much as ſtir himſelf.</p>
               <p>In fine, the <hi>Colonna's</hi> perceiving that all their Engines were fruitleſs: that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſell <hi>Ceſarini</hi> continued conſtant in her reſolution, that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador ſtood neutral; that the King gave the Lady her liberty to take <hi>D. Frederick</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions mentioned in the Teſtament; that the <hi>Sforza's</hi> were engaged in the <hi>French</hi> Faction: their laſt recourſe was to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law.</p>
               <p>Madamoiſel <hi>Ceſarini</hi> had made a Vow of Stability in the Convent where ſhe was bred. It muſt be decided if that Vow hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to marry, and if there was need of a Diſpenſation. His Holineſs, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> named Commiſſioners to examine the quality of that Vow; who having conſulted, written, and deliberated thereupon, Judged, that kind of Bond was but a ſimple Promiſe before God, which had not the force of a Solemn Vow, and from which, her Confeſſor, Authoriſed by the Pope, might abſolve her. So that there remained no more to put an end to that perplexity, but to Joyn the two Parties by the Bond of Marriage. <hi>D. Frederick</hi> was already recalled from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and had been ſome time at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:44266:40"/>without appearing publickly, that he might not expoſe himſelf to ſome inſult of his Adverſaries. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> conſented to the Marriage; but, to pacifie the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, and comfort the Duke of <hi>Sonino,</hi> as Juſtice did require; having married the younger Siſter, upon the good faith and promiſe of the elder; it was agreed upon, that under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the childen of the two Siſters, ſhould ſhare amongſt them the Eſtate of the Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> their Unckle after his Death, or whenſoever he ſhould be pleaſed to reſign it.</p>
               <p>And thus ye have the Cataſtrophe of a Play that made ſo much ſhew upon the moſt illuſtrious Theater of Chriſtendom; and though the Intrigue of a Marriage made the Plot, yet Love had a far leſs ſhare in it than Intereſt; and this is not to be wondred at, ſeeing the Scene is laid in a Countrey, where galantry yields com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to policy.</p>
               <p>Since the Marriage; the two Siſters and their Husbands are made good Friends by the authority of the moſt Chriſtian King, who hath taken theſe two Houſes into his Protection, whereof he hath given them an illuſtrious Mark, by the blew Ribbon wherewith he hath honoured them, as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44266:40"/>that they are the worthy inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Zeal, which the late Duke <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarini</hi> had for the Intereſts of the <hi>French</hi> Crown.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Intrigues of Cardinal <hi>Palazzi</hi> Altieri, in the Promotion of ſeveral Cardinals.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Men reflected on the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Cardinalſhip, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that other wayes ſhould be thought on for attaining to it, than moſt part of thoſe, who have advanced to that dignity have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever People are pleaſed to ſay of that dignity, yet it is by it, that one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a Society, out of which, for a long time have been choſen the Popes, who, in the Language of the Court are the viſible heads of the Church, the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Vicars of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there is none of thoſe who conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that Sacred Colledge, that may not pretend to the Papacy; and by conſequent, that ought not to have ſuch qualities as are requiſite for governing the whole Church: or if there be ſome who ſeem naturally excluded from the Pontificate, by a practice brought into cuſtom, and which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44266:41"/>I blame not (becauſe I ought to ſuppoſe it (I am told) to be for the good of the Church) they have at leaſt the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of chooſing the Pope; and conſequently ought to be endowed with the zeal and knowledge neceſſary, for diſcerning of him that beſt deſerves the place.</p>
               <p>I wave this, that the moſt important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of Chriſtendom are decided by them, in ſo many Congregations moſt wiſely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: that their decrees in controverted points, are held to give repoſe to other Churches, tranquility to Conſciences; and in very many places, the meaſure to Civil Laws.</p>
               <p>Nor do I pretend to inhaunce the eſteem due to that dignity, by the antiquity of its original, the greatneſs of its progreſs, and the ſanctity of illuſtrious men that have been raiſed to it; there are Books which treat of that at large. It is enough, which ſome (with what reaſon I know not) tell us, that the Cardinals are in place of the Seventy Diſciples, and that they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the holy Elders that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne.</p>
               <p>It is matter then of aſtoniſhment that now a dayes that important place is no otherwayes conſidered, but as a Civil and Secular Dignity, and that moſt part are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44266:42"/>called to it by maximes ſo remote from the Sanctity of its primary Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>It is not my deſign however, to obſerve in this place the wayes that are taken to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it, that would be to engage in too particular a Scrutiny. I will onely tell ye by the by, that the way of merit is leaſt followed by thoſe, who march towards the eminence whereof we ſpeak; whether it be that it is the leaſt ſucceſsful, or that it is the longeſt and moſt troubleſome rode: hence it is, that even at <hi>Rome,</hi> when any man, commendable for Virtue and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comes to be promoted to the Purple, they commonly ſay, that he is gone to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by the <hi>Longara;</hi> that is, a long ſtreet that reaches from the Port <hi>Septimiana</hi> to the Hoſpital of the Holy Ghoſt, and the longeſt way to go to the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In effect, if we would well examine thoſe who compoſe the Sacred Colledge, we ſhould find, that excepting the Cardinals which are called National, and are but few in number, it is filled, either by <hi>Genoeſes</hi> that have got into it, by buying the chief pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Chamber, or by <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Tuſcans</hi> by the Intereſt of Families, that have been allied to the Families of ſo many Popes, who have been almoſt ſucceſſively of the ſame Countrey: or by <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:44266:42"/>who are introduced by baſe and fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning compliances with the Popes Nephews; or, in a word, by ſome <hi>Milaneſes,</hi> or <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> who have been advanced out of meer Policy, that by their Faction they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Dominion in the States of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In proſpect of this, Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was no ſooner made Nephew to <hi>Clement</hi> the X. but he made it his whole buſineſs to raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Creatures.</p>
               <p>There were three Cardinals places va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in a ſhort time. It was believed at firſt, that in this promotion the Pope would call to mind the obligations that he had to the Houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi. Clement</hi> the IX. their Unckle preferred him to be Maſter of his Chamber, and afterward made him Cardinal: beſides, he had not been elected Pope, but becauſe he was his Creature, eſpecially by the Votes of the <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; inſomuch, that being obliged to the Houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> for what he was, Men were perſwaded with good ground that he would beſtow one of the vacant Hats on the ſame Houſe, which was otherwiſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable to the Holy See, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the late Pope, and of his Kindred, during the time of ſo glorious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Papacy.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:44266:43"/>
               <p>But men were deceived of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, it was not the Pope that made Cardinals. Cardinal <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tieri</hi> would have Men of his own, and one of the <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> would have been the Popes: ſo that theſe three Hats were given to three Prelats who were at the diſpoſal of the Regnant, to <hi>Carpegna, Borromei,</hi> and <hi>Maſſini.</hi> The firſt was a <hi>Roman,</hi> Datary, and a Kinſman; the ſecond a <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> Secretary of State, and a Favorite; the third, a <hi>Roman,</hi> but by an antient habit, and ſecret engagement a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and beſides a Friend of <hi>Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have ſaid, that the Pope, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the will of his Nephew, named <hi>Boromei;</hi> but beſides that, the Holy Father was no fit perſon for conteſting about any thing; it is to be preſumed that Cardinal <hi>Alteri</hi> was not againſt it, becauſe his office made him depend on him, and that he was of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, by the inclination of his Birth, and the Engagement of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roſpiglioſi's</hi> are then excluded from this Promotion: and becauſe that all good men murmured at it, that the Pope was therefore taxed of ingratitude; that the deceaſed Pope had done far more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in reſpect of the <hi>Chigi</hi>'s, having moade
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44266:43"/>D. <hi>Sigiſmond Chigi</hi> Cardinal in the firſt Promotion; that the <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi>'s were men of ſufficient Merit, though the Pope had had no obligation to them; that granting the <hi>Roſpiglioſi's</hi> had nothing in them that deſerved conſideration, but the qualities of the Unckle; yet a Hat was due to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſo holy a Man: but Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> uſed cunning to divert the Publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, which by theſe rumours fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Government.</p>
               <p>He pretended, that Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> himſelf oppoſed the good intentions his Holineſs had, of promoting one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be Cardinal.</p>
               <p>This pretext had ſome colour. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> had three Brothers, one who married the daughter of Sieur <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> a rich <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> in conſideration of which Marriage, Mr. <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> Unckle to the Maid, was made Cardinal; another called <hi>D. Vincent,</hi> Commander of <hi>Santa Euphemia,</hi> who had been General of the Popes Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and a third, <hi>D. Felix</hi> an Abbot. He had greater kindneſs for <hi>D. Felix</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the three, than for <hi>D. Vincent,</hi> with whom he had never been well reconciled, ſince the Jealouſies that ſet them at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, during the Pontificat of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle. Some ill affected perſons at Court
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44266:44"/>had fomented theſe Jealouſies betwixt the two brothers, that by their Diviſions they might govern Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was more eaſie for them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> than of <hi>Vincent,</hi> they had alwayes kept him as much as they could from the knowledge of affairs; and for that end made uſe of the occaſion of the ſiege of <hi>Candie,</hi> to ſend him thither twice with the Popes Galleys, whilſt in the mean time they ſwayed the mind of the Cardinal at their pleaſures, entertaining him ſtill in Umbrages with his Brother. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that after the death of <hi>Clement</hi> the the IX. the averſion that Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> had for <hi>D. Vincent</hi> continued ſtill.</p>
               <p>This was favourable for Cardinal <hi>Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> If <hi>D. Vincent,</hi> by the voice of his Friends, complained of the injuſtice done him, in forgetting him in the promotion; it was anſwered, that His Holineſs had the beſt intentions in the World for the Houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi;</hi> that he was troubled he could not give ſuch teſtimonies of it as he deſired; that his hands were tied by the bad underſtanding that was amongſt the Brothers; that he could not give the Hat to <hi>D. Vincent,</hi> without diſobliging the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal his Brother; that neither could he declare himſelf for <hi>D. Felix</hi> without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44266:44"/>D. <hi>Vincent.</hi> who was his elder Brother; that it behoved the Cardinal at leaſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, on whom of the two he would have him beſtow it.</p>
               <p>And the ſame reaſons were thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer all that could be ſaid of the excluſion of the <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi>'s. But it was well known, that it was onely Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri</hi> his fault that the two Brothers were not reconciled together; that the onely way to unite them was to render them equal in dignity; that Cardinal <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiglioſi</hi> was a man of too much reaſon not to live in good intelligence with a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he ſhould ſee every day in the ſame Chappels, the ſame Congregations, in the ſame habit, and in the Functions that are common to the whole Colledge, that was far from the thoughts of <hi>Altieri;</hi> he was well ſatisfied to make his beſt uſe of that bad intelligence, and even foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by ſome that had credit with <hi>Roſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioſi,</hi> becauſe that whilſt matters continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that ſtate, he might delay the time, and not be engaged to give a Hat to that Houſe, and by conſequent might diſpoſe of the places that ſhould fall vacant in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his own Creatures. The better to cloak his deſign, when he found that the antipathy which the Cardinal had foul <hi>D.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44266:45"/>Vincent</hi> was come to that height, as that he ſhould ſay, he had rather have no Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal in his houſe, than to have <hi>D. Vincent</hi> one; he told him, that his Holineſs gave him the diſpoſal of a place in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when any ſhould be void; and that it ſhould be his own fault if it were not filled by one of his Brothers.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> accepted it with Thanks, and with a teſtimony of his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for the Abbot <hi>Felix</hi> his youngeſt Brother. This ſtuck ſo in the thoughts of <hi>D. Vincent,</hi> that being enraged, he loſt both the health of his body and mind; which obliged his Relations to ſend him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> to their Countrey Houſe of <hi>Zagaru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lo,</hi> and then to <hi>Piſtoye,</hi> where, within a few dayes after he died.</p>
               <p>But, it was a long time before Abbot <hi>Felix Roſpiglioſt</hi> came to his promotion; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpake for him but Merit, and that ſignified but little to the Regnant humor: beſides, Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> perceived, that by making of him Cardinal, he ought, in decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to give him wherewith to maintain that dignity; becauſe the <hi>Roſpiglioſi's,</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews of the late Pope, were ſo honeſt men, that in ſtead of enriching themſelves under the Pontificat of their Unckle, they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44266:45"/>had much impaired the eſtate of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
               <p>Another conjuncture beſides happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which delayed the promotion of the Abbot <hi>Felix,</hi> and we are now inſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in another Intrigue of Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> had for a long time aſpired to a Cardinalſhip: in the time of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. he had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that dignity by the nomination of the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> he had long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> the Abbot <hi>Bonfils,</hi> who was ſent thither for the affairs of the houſe of <hi>Vendome;</hi> and afterward Mr. <hi>Faucher,</hi> that he might double his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; amongſt other things he repreſented to the Palace, the conſideration which the Holy See ought to have for the ſervices which the Houſe of <hi>Vendome</hi> actually ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Chriſtendom; that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> had ſacrifiſed himſelf at <hi>Candie</hi> for the common Cauſe; that the Cardinal of <hi>Vendome</hi> ſpared no means in ſeconding his Holineſs in his pious deſign of aſſiſting the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> and becauſe both theſe Brothers died, the Agents preſſed his Holineſs more vigorouſly than before, to comfort that afflicted Houſe; ſhewing him, that he could not do it better, than
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44266:46"/>by giving a Hat to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> who was next of Kin, and the honorary Guardian of the young Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Vendome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet they could not obtain that of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the IX. becauſe probably he thought he had done enough for the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> that he admitted and owned the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of that Nation, againſt all the Factions of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that he had declared null the Marriage contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and Mademoiſelle of <hi>Nemours,</hi> giving her thereby liberty to marry <hi>D. Pedro:</hi> probably alſo becauſe of other engagements, to which by civility and decorum he was obliged, ſeeing no fault could be ever found in his conduct; ſo that <hi>Clement</hi> the X. ſucceeding to him, the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> renewed his Offices. The Cardinals of <hi>Eſte,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> the one as Protector of <hi>Portugal,</hi> received orders to propoſe him to the new Pope, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Protector of <hi>France,</hi> to joyn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the recommendation of his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty: but, all that did but little advance his affairs, and except ſome few good words, which they that know the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ought to take for a civil denyal, they left him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; they heard his inſtances, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44266:46"/>ſhewed a diſpoſition to his deſires: for theſe are the myſterious maxims of the Palace, when they have a mind to keep men in a long expectation, or at length to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them out, and make them take another courſe; which moſt people that have not full experience of that Court, cannot well dive into, but with a great deal of time.</p>
               <p>This made the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> aſſiſted by the Miniſtry of Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> (who underſtood <hi>Rome</hi> as well as any Miniſter that ever <hi>France</hi> had) find an honeſt pretext of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might in perſon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate his own concern. He ſet upon his journey about the end of the Spring, in the year 1670. with the character of Miniſter of the Crown Extraordinary, for the affairs of the King. Having made a happy journey through <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Lombardie,</hi> where he received the honors due to his Merit and Character, excepting ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities at <hi>Parma,</hi> whereat he ſhewed ſome diſcontent: Having been treated at <hi>Turin</hi> in a Royal manner as a kinſman; in a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner at <hi>Modena</hi> as a friend, at <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and all the State of the Pope, in an Eccleſiaſtical way as a Prelate; he arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> full of hopes of ſeeing himſelf quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cardinal.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:44266:47"/>
               <p>But affairs were longer protracted than he expected, there were powerful men in <hi>France,</hi> and of high credit at Court; who were not altogether glad of his exaltation, either out of jealouſie of his grandeur, or becauſe it put by ſome other that aſpired to the ſame dignity; and they were ſo much the ſtronger that Mr. <hi>de Lionne,</hi> who was the beſt ſupport of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> died in the heat of the affair. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> vigorouſly withſtood his deſigns, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted they would never ſuffer him to be made Cardinal, unleſs they had one of their Nation, by reaſon of the equality, as they ſaid, that the Pope is obliged to obſerve in regard of Crowns: The moſt Chriſtian King thought it not fit to name him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would thereby have loſt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of another, which is due to him at preſent; he pretended that his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation joyned to the nomination of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was enough to incline the Holy Father to ſatisfie him. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was attacked on all hands: if the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> preſſed him to ſhew the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Holineſs's promiſe; he had immediately the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> on his top, who repreſented to him, that the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> had the ſame pretenſions for making Father <hi>Nitard</hi> Cardinal at her
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44266:47"/>recommendation, as the King of <hi>France</hi> had for the Biſhop of <hi>Laon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt know that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, was he whom the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſatisfie Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and his party; and becauſe ſhe had with much reluctancy thus diſmiſſed him, being her Confeſſor, Confident, and Counſellor, ſhe was willing to honor that kind of exile by all the real marks of a conſtant friendſhip: After ſhe had removed the Marquis of <hi>Aſtorgas</hi> from his Ambaſſie at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Vice-Royalty of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhe uſed violence upon the retirement and modeſtie of that good Father, brought him out from among the Jeſuits, made him a Prelate, and gave him the chief charge of the affairs of the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> but the good will of that Princeſs reſted not there, ſhe would ſtill crown her work by adorning him with Purple; and himſelf laid hold on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of the inſtances that the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> made at the Palace; to advance at the ſame ſtep with him to the Cardinalſhip.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee then two Prelats of two Crowns in the ſame pretenſions, and Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> in a great puzzle, he cannot content the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> without diſpleaſing Father <hi>Nitard;</hi> he cannot ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and of the King of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44266:48"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> without offending the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Spain,</hi> or one Hat muſt coſt him two; and if he make the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> Cardinal, he muſt at the ſame time do as much for Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> or, in fine, if he make neither of the two, he muſt incurr all their diſpleaſure alike. Nevertheleſs, he makes his advantage of theſe debates to gain time; and in the mean time, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> preſs him, he tells him, that if he will find a way to ſatisfie <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſhall immediately have what he deſires: he follows the ſame courſe with Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> but that Father does not much importune him, he perceives that the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> does his buſineſs for him, and it is enough for him only to make proteſtations, that he is in no haſte for a Cardinalſhip; but that he hopes they will not do that injuſtice to <hi>Spain,</hi> to give a Cardinal to <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> not to have the ſame favour from the Holy See.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> was not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, provided he were Cardinal, though Father <hi>Nitard</hi> had likewiſe a Hat; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that in agenting his own affairs, he laboured for <hi>Nitard,</hi> whilſt that Prelate did not at all ſollicite <hi>Altieri;</hi> he believed that <hi>Altieri</hi> conſpired with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that he himſelf had ſollicited them to make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44266:48"/>that inſtance, that he might rid himſelf of him; and that ſo it was but a colourable pretext of thoſe of the Palace; that they might ſhun the giving of ſatisfaction to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to which they durſt not give an open refuſal.</p>
               <p>By this artifice matters were delayed, and the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> could not forbear to teſtifie his impatience. What Letters were not procured from <hi>France?</hi> What Offices were not imployed with the Pope, to beſeech him, with his kinſmen to gain them, with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make ſure of them? It is enough to tell you, that Mr. <hi>de Lionne</hi> managed the affair; he brought things ſo about, that the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> who being entruſted with the affairs of the Crown in that Court; it is to be preſumed that there was not any that touched him nearer, than that affair wherein the King intereſted himſelf for his Brother, who had been made to ſpend there a year of noviciat for the Cardinalſhip, though his merit raiſed him above many others, that met not with the ſame difficulty.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Inſtructions that the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> brought from <hi>France,</hi> none ſeemed of greater importance at that time, than the Propoſition he was to make to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44266:49"/>Pope, for the reſtitution of the State of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>Romciglione</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not my deſign to diſcuſs that long affair in this place. It is enough for my purpoſe, to ſay that that Eſtate having been engaged to the Apoſtolick Chamber, and ſince incamerated, that is, annexed to the reſt of the Eccleſiaſtical State, by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. The ſame Pope by the Treaty of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and by the Articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation betwixt his Holineſs and the moſt Chriſtian King, obliged himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſum of 1600000 Crowns and upwards, which the Houſe of <hi>Parma</hi> was indebted to the Apoſtolique Chamber, and for which it was mortgaged and incame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. The death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the repayment, and <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. eaſily waved the Treating of that affair, by the good intelligence that he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that his Pontificate having been but ſhort, and being expired without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance made to him concerning the Treaty of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and the repayment of the Money; to content the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> it behoved to be brought upon the Carpet under <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the X.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:44266:49"/>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt to urge that affair briskly; for beſides the ſatisfaction of the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> he had hopes likewiſe to draw ſome advantage from it for the Cardinalſhip of his Brother, and for all other things that he might pretend to from the Palace, and the reaſon was this,</p>
               <p>The reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> will be always an odious thing to the Popes, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Eccleſiaſtick State; becauſe it will be a conceſſion, that the Popes may be deceived, the Eſtate of <hi>Caſtro</hi> having been incamerated and diſmcamerated by one and the ſame Pope, with advice of the ſame Cardinals, which uſhers in an infinite number of vexatious conſequences to the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> beſides, it would place a Sovereign Prince at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſettle a Sanctuary for all the diſcontented; ſo that all Popes will as much as poſſibly they can excuſe themſelves from reſtoring it, and will diſown what <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. did, that they may not leave an offenſive memory of their Papacy to the Holy See.</p>
               <p>That being ſo, the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> might very well promiſe himſelf, that Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the X. to avoid the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> would grant all that could be deſired
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44266:50"/>of him in <hi>France:</hi> and indeed it was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er propoſed, but that in ſo quaint a Court, the deſigne of it was preſently ſmelt out; that to ſtifle that propoſition, there needed no more; but to give a Hat to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon;</hi> that it was not of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the <hi>French</hi> King, whether <hi>Caſtro</hi> returned to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> or not, but that he would let matters go with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, provided, that in other things he were ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the voices of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Prelates of the Court were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſome of them were of opinion, that it would be better for the Holy See, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve once for all to reſtore <hi>Caſtro:</hi> that when the <hi>French</hi> ſhould have that demand no more to make, they would be more free at <hi>Rome</hi> in the meaſures which ought to be taken with <hi>France;</hi> when otherwiſe it would always prove a thorn in their foot, and whenſoever the <hi>French</hi> King had a mind to have any thing granted him by the Court, he would preſently ſet on foot the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Caſtro;</hi> ſo that the reſtitution would put an end to that plea, and his Majeſty would have no more opportunity of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying his Ambaſſies with bravadoes.</p>
               <p>Others were of the contrary opinion; that when the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould fail of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44266:50"/>that means, he would find others; that if he had none elſe but what he pretends from his predeceſſors, of having protected the Holy See, yet he would not want pretexts to back his claims; that the ſtate of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> alone, which in ſome manner makes <hi>Rome</hi> depend on him, would give him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity enough, whenſoever he had a mind to ſhew his reſentments; that the liberties and immunities of his Kingdom, made him even powerful enough to pretend to more; that moreover, he might from time to time have what he deſired, without any loſs or expence to the Holy See. What did the Popes give away of the Revenues of the Church, by granting Hats, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and the like favours? when on the other hand, the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> would diſmember the Eccleſiaſtick State, beſides the prejudices before mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Palace inclined to this laſt advice, which was to ſatisfie the Ambaſſador in the other points of his Inſtructions: but that the Pope might not be troubled with the buſineſs of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> during his Reign; he reſolved thereupon to take the opinions of all the Cardinals, aſſembled in full conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; which he did, and put the ſuffrages into a box well ſealed; cauſing them to be carried to the Treaſury in the Caſtle of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44266:51"/>
                  <hi>St. Angelo,</hi> that he might have his recourſe to, and take his meaſures by them, when any new inſtance ſhould be made to him about that concern. This courſe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the voices might be given with more freedom, and that it might not be ſaid, they were carried by private intereſt; ſo that the diſcovery of this myſtery is to be expected at ſome other conjuncture: for it hath not been moved ſince, and my Lord Ambaſſador ſeemed to urge it no more: whence it was concluded, that he had had fair promiſes, as to what he was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> ſeems now ſure of a Hat, but delays are dangerous: the Pope is old, what if he die? what if the King of <hi>France</hi> remit his inſtances? If his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports fail? If the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> change; he will find himſelf wide in his meaſures. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> muſt therefore be urged to declare himſelf, and to promiſe to make him Cardinal at the firſt promotion: But Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> makes uſe of ſhifts; he ſees a neceſſity of giving three Hats, one to <hi>Roſpiglinſi;</hi> another to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> and a third to Father <hi>Nitard;</hi> and amongſt all theſe three Cardinals to be named, there is not one that depends on him; one is for the faction of the late Pope, the other
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44266:51"/>for <hi>France,</hi> and the laſt for <hi>Spain.</hi> Beſides, he perceives that theſe promotions are not upon the account of Crowns; that they are but bare recommendations, and not nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; that within a little the Kings muſt be ſatisfied by a new promotion. He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs engaged; he prays the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> to have patience; to find out ſome way to eaſe his Holineſs, who hath ſo good inclinations for him; and who would have certainly granted already all that he deſires and deſerves; if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his good intentions; that he could not ſo much as yet acquit himſelf of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations he had to the houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi:</hi> In a word, he conjures him to think of ſome way himſelf of being made Cardinal at the firſt promotion, without offending the Family of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to propoſe the ſame to the Pope, which would doe him a ſingular pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Some Biaſs muſt be then thought upon for the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> that may not give offence to the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, and may take all further excuſe from Cardinal <hi>Altieri.</hi> It was thought that no better expedient could be found out, than to demand for the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> the Hat which was promiſed to Cardinal <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piglioſi</hi> for one of his Brothers, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44266:52"/>of the Pope had aſſured him at the firſt promotion: by this means the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had nothing to object againſt the Pope; and the <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi>'s giving their conſent, all men ought to be ſatisfied. It was propoſed to Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi;</hi> and that Cardinal who makes it his whole buſineſs to oblige, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the propoſition, and freely offered not only that, but if it were needful for the ſatisfaction of the King, he was ready to reſign his own; he goes to the Palace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it himſelf to Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> and the Pope; and ſollicites for the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> with as much zeal as can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any man in his own concerns.</p>
               <p>What ſhifts and excuſes can now be found out in the Palace? yield they muſt: yet Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> however thinks of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching; he informs Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> under-hand, that he would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what engagement he put himſelf into; that he ſhould have a care not to do an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Family, by renouncing his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that he cannot juſtifie himſelf to his Brother when it comes to his turn to be made Cardinal, if he let ſlip the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; if his Holineſs ſhould die before he beſtow a Hat on D. <hi>Felix Roſpiglioſi,</hi> his hopes will be loſt, becauſe another Pope will not be obliged to it; That ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44266:52"/>a Declaration for a <hi>French</hi> Prelate, will put him in bad intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> In a word, he makes uſe of all the arguments he can imagine, to ſhake or cool Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> in his reſolutions; but perceiving no impreſſion to be made thereby on his mind, it behoved him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all imaginable reluctancy, to promiſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> that he ſhould be Cardinal at the firſt Promotion.</p>
               <p>The day of promotion is not known by many, unleſs ſometimes the night before, or the morning when it is performed; and many times no body knows anything of it till after the conſiſtory.</p>
               <p>When it was made known, that the Pope had appointed a conſiſtory to declare Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and to fill the vacant places, then preſently the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> was talked on, as the firſt of thoſe that were to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without ſtaying till he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; he is waited upon, and compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the great and ſpacious Palace of <hi>Farneze</hi> is hardly big enough to receive all that come to him.</p>
               <p>But ſome hours after the Scene is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Pope makes Cardinals; ſome he names, and reſerves one <hi>in pectore.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> is out of all patience, to ſee ſo long an expectation diſappointed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44266:53"/>and ſo poſitive promiſes without effect; He complains highly; but they endeavour to appeaſe him, by aſſuring him that he is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>in pectore;</hi> that the Pope, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſiderations, was hindred from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him, but that in time he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him: yet nothing can pacifie him; he writes to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and engages Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> to joyn with him in his grievances. The King and Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> have the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances given them, that the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> is Cardinal from the day of the promotion; that the Pope has reſerved him <hi>in pectore;</hi> that he may be at quiet, and not doubt of it; but all this is not ſufficient to free the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> from a deep melancholly.</p>
               <p>Who can ſee into the Popes heart? and though one might ſee there the name of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar D'Eſtrees</hi> Cardinal, who can promiſe but Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> by the abſolute power he has over the Pope, will not efface the characters? or give it out, that the Pope has a weak memory, as he hath ſo often done already, that he may at his pleaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all things? who is ignorant that theſe reſervations <hi>in pectore,</hi> are the ingines of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to keep many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in expectation at the ſame time? Who can promiſe, but that they will keep the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44266:53"/>Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> ſtill in hopes, until that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the death of the Pope, or ſome other conjuncture may give the Nephew Regnant opportunity of leaving, both the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> and <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> in the mire.</p>
               <p>All theſe reflexions concurring with the loſs of Mr <hi>de Lionne,</hi> who was ſhatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a very ſudden death, were ſtrong enough to overcome the conſtancy of a more patient man than the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> and to kindle a choler leſs ſuſceptible of ſlames than his.</p>
               <p>Some were perſwaded that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from <hi>Rome</hi> with his Brother the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, as has been practiſed upon like ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; others thought, that the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Caſtro</hi> would be brought upon the ſtage again afreſh: but they judged it more convenient to continue their inſtances at Court, wherin they ran no riſque: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by taking the other courſe, beſides that they would have engaged the King; they ran hazard of loſing all.</p>
               <p>They therefore patiently expected the fulfilling of the promiſes and aſſurances that were made to them, with ſo much the more encouragement, that notwithſtanding the death of Mr. <hi>de Lionne,</hi> and the effects of their enemies, yet the King ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them with his protection. But the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44266:54"/>promotion that was made the following winter, almoſt quite daſh'd all their hopes. For the better underſtanding of this matter, we muſt paſs to another Intrigue,</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Bonzi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beziers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed from the Ambaſſie of <hi>Venice</hi> to that of <hi>Poland,</hi> in very troubleſome times, performed ſo good ſervices to that Crown, that King <hi>Caſimir</hi> named him to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip under <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. But that Pope, who to the day of his death, had ſhunned all occaſions of ſhewing kindneſs to <hi>France,</hi> dying, without granting any thing to <hi>Poland,</hi> in the laſt promotion which he made for Crowns, that Prelate was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of his pretenſions. Under <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. the ſucceſſor of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he had his nomination renewed by the King, and the Cardinals <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> and <hi>Eſte</hi> were by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſſing Letters from his Polonian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, charged with that affair: but that great Pope having other engagements, that inſenſibly drew him another way, even to the end of his Pontificate, which laſted not full two years and a half, matters continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were.</p>
               <p>He had not hitherto made any better progreſs under the preſent Pontificat, tho King <hi>Michael Vignovieski</hi> upon his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> confirmed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44266:54"/>the nomination of King <hi>Caſimir</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor.</p>
               <p>He therefore nicked his time, thinking no opportunity more proper for ſucceeding in his deſigns than the preſent. His hopes were backed with many conſiderations: Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was ſollicited by the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to do Juſtice to that Crown, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many excluſions in the Promotions that had been made at the nomination of other Princes. The Emperour had the ſame right to make his inſtances for the Empire, becauſe neither the one nor other had had any Cardinals under <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth. But that which wrought moſt for Mr. <hi>de Bonzi,</hi> was, that Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> though he had no inclination to give a Hat to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> yet he was unwilling to diſoblige the King of <hi>France.</hi> What courſe is then taken in favour of Mr. <hi>de Bonzi?</hi> they put Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> in head, that by giving Mr. <hi>de Bonzi</hi> a Hat, he'le ſatisfie <hi>Poland,</hi> and with the ſame hand give contentment to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who will have no ground to preſs ſo much for the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> when his Majeſty ſees one of his Subjects, and one of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters raiſed to the Cardinalſhip; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Florentin</hi> by Nation, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will have leſs cauſe of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44266:55"/>and that ſo one ſingle Hat will be worth him three, one, which, ſoon or late he muſt give to Mr. <hi>Bonzi,</hi> another that he was engaged to beſtow on the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> and a third which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for Father <hi>Nitard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have given out, that the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> made uſe of that artifice to bafle him, and that they incited Mr. <hi>de Bonzi</hi> to make his propoſition at the Palace, the more to ſtir up the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who would not ſuffer the elevation of two <hi>French</hi> Prelats, advanced by Forreign Princes to their prejudice: ſo that if there was any ground in that conjecture, it was not the way to advance the affairs of Mr. <hi>de Bonzi,</hi> but to entangle him as well as the Biſhop of <hi>Laon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others ſaid, that the Cardinals <hi>Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> and <hi>Carpegna</hi> conſpiring with <hi>Altieri,</hi> deviſed that clutter, to give the laſt blow to the pretenſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However the matter was, it is certain Mr. <hi>de Bonzi</hi> at that time took very good meaſures, becauſe without much negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he with three others was declared Cardinal, in the promotion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have ſpoken, which was made in the month of <hi>February;</hi> the Pope having
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44266:55"/>ſtill reſerved <hi>in peciore</hi> him, whom he had not named in the former promotion.</p>
               <p>Many people were ſurpriſed when they ſaw Cardinals created, and no mention made of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon:</hi> no body could tell what to ſay of that Myſterie; but in general there were no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters expected for that Prelate. His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mortification was to be obliged to thank the Palace for the promotion of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bonzi;</hi> and to teſtifie his joy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe it was an advantage for the Crown: yet he performed it with much conſtancy, and made his private diſcontent give place to a publick rejoycing.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> in the mean time trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed; he perſwaded himſelf that he had ſatisfied all parties: the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in his opinion, had nothing to demand, ſeeing the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> was not declared Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal: that the King of <hi>France</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his ſollicitations, having given him a Cardinal, by ſatisfying the nomination of <hi>Poland.</hi> Thus he made his Accompts, but matters will not go ſo: and after the long turnings and windings that he hath made, the Biſhop of <hi>Laons</hi> Hat will coſt him four, two, which he hath already given to <hi>Poland</hi> and the Empire, and two, which muſt be given in the next promotion to the Biſhop
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44266:56"/>of <hi>Laon</hi> and Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> that is to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> without reckoning ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he will be ſtill indebted to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in compenſation of the promotion of <hi>Nitard,</hi> which his Majeſty will pretend to be made at the nomination of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hardly had Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> received the Compliments, which were made him on all hands, upon account of the laſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that he was more vigorouſly than ever ſollicited by <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> to oblige him to make his holineſs declare in favour of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> whom he had long reſerved <hi>in peciore.</hi> They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that it was too great an amuſement for a Prelate of his merit; that though no regard were had to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances made on his behalfe, yet it was a thing due ſolely to the ſervices of the houſe of <hi>Vendome</hi> done for the Holy See: they added beſides the weight that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the King of <hi>France</hi> ought to have, who was then about to begin a War ſo advantageous to Religion and the Church, by the Liberty which he was about to reſtore to the Catholicks in <hi>Holland,</hi> and which, by conſequent, would render the Pontificat of <hi>Clement</hi> the X. glorious to Poſterity. Why ſhould there ſo much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44266:56"/>difficulty be made to fill the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with men illuſtrious for piety, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and birth, preſented to the Pope by Princes, when ſome were cloathed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who very often had no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation but that of a baſe and ſervile compliance?</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> could not diſguiſe his averſion againſt ſo many promotions, by which he made no Creatures: if the Pope ſhould come to die, what intereſt could he make in the Conclave without Electors at his devotion? What friendſhip could he find in the Cardinals that were not at all obliged to him, becauſe he made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will? What party ſhould he take? What aſſiſtance expect in time of need, being at <hi>Rome</hi> without a Faction; in bad intelligence in <hi>France;</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> without advancement? the Cardinalſhip of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> begets him an enemy in the Colledge, and that dignity for the future will ſerve onely to make his enemy more powerful. The Hat of Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> which he cannot refuſe to the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> raiſes him as many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in that Kingdom, as Father <hi>Nitard</hi> has envyers, that is to ſay, Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the moſt part of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees at Court, who obliged the Queen to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44266:57"/>ſend him away. Theſe reflections ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toſſed the mind of <hi>Altieri:</hi> but he muſt at length condeſcend; he is too far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; there are places void; and he is urged without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>In fine, after that the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> had languiſhed in expectation almoſt two years, he is at laſt made Cardinal; and to juſtifie the good intentions of his holineſs, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he is the perſon whom the Pope hath had <hi>in peciore</hi> almoſt a year; and ſo he is comforted by giving him the precedence before thoſe that were created ſince that time.</p>
               <p>This is the upſhot of that ſo perplexed Intrigue; and, ſhould we tell the thoughts of the moſt diſintereſted of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> we might acknowledge with them, that the Nephew of a Pope might have come off with more ſatisfaction to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and leſs diſadvantage to himſelf. He might, from the beginning, by granting a Hat to the nomination of <hi>Portugal,</hi> have done ſomewhat for the advantage of the Church with that Crown, and gotten from thence a conſiderable ſum of the Revenues of the Biſhopricks, which had been put under Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration during the long Vacation of that Countrey, to be employed in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt the Turck,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44266:57"/>and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could have found nothing to blame in that conduct.</p>
               <p>Next he might, upon the reſignation that Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> made, have given that Hat to the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> and all men would have applauded ſuch an action.</p>
               <p>In fine, in the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> when he came at length to have him declared Cardinal, he might have ſhewn ſome forwardneſs to make that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſeem more conſpicuous and free, which from the beginning to the end ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all along forced and conſtrained.</p>
               <p>But either his engagement with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> to whom he owed his quality of Nephew, more than to any other, or his own intereſt, to make himſelf creatures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him to do ſo: yet, in ſpight of his teeth, he ſaw four Hats go out of his hands, for which no man was obliged to him.</p>
               <p>The Cardinalſhip of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> put off the promotion of <hi>D. Felix Roſpigli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſi,</hi> who had generouſly made over his place to him, ſo that <hi>France</hi> was obliged to ſollicite Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> that ſo ſoon as he could he would have reſpect to the Houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi.</hi> And in ſolliciting of that Affair, the Duke and Cardinal <hi>d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrees</hi> gave the Palace no time to breath.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:44266:58"/>
               <p>Fortune, it ſeems, never favoured the Nephew of a Pope, ſo much as <hi>Altieri;</hi> there have not been obſerved in many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo many places vacant in the ſacred Colledge in ſo ſhort a time, as have been in the Pontificat of <hi>Clement</hi> the X. This has given occaſion to many of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſay, That a Juſt Judgment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was to be ſeen in the death of ſo many Cardinals, becauſe having choſen <hi>Clement</hi> the X. Pope, in the thoughts that he could not reign long, it ſeemed that in a ſhort time he ſhould bury all thoſe that had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him.</p>
               <p>In leſs than three years, more than Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were already dead, ſo that ſince the laſt promotion in a ſhort time there were places to be filled. One was demanded for the Abbot <hi>Felix Roſpiglioſi,</hi> and the merit of his family concurring with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the King of <hi>France;</hi> and, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that the Pope had to the memory of his Unckle, carried it at length over the conduct of <hi>Altieri,</hi> who was wholly addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the making of his Family, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting of the Benefices of the Cardinals that died, for the uſe of himſelf and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, as he would have been willing to have diſpoſed of their Hats to men at his devotion, if he had been ſuffered to do ſo.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:44266:58"/>
               <p>The Joy of the People, and of all honeſt men, upon the promotion of the Abbot <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiglioſi,</hi> is unexpreſſible, by reaſon of his good qualities, and the veneration wherein his Unckle <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth was held: but they would not endure that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſhould give him a Hat without a Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to ſpeak in the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, that is to ſay, without crowning his merit with ſome Office or Benefice, to maintain his Dignity. And eſpecially when <hi>D. Vincent Roſpiglioſi</hi> died, it was thought ſtrange that he inveſted him not in the places of his Brother, having given the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Santa Euphemia,</hi> which <hi>D. Vincent</hi> enjoyed, to a grand Nephew, ſon to Don <hi>Gaſparo Altieri,</hi> who was but then in the cradle.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the chief promotions of that Reign. However there are others not a little curious; but, ſeeing to diſcourſe of them it behoved me to give an account of the Preſent State of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> it would carry me too far beyond my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Intrigues of Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi Altieri</hi> with Princes and their Miniſters.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Popes began to divide the cares of the Papacy with their Kinſmen; theſe new <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules's</hi> have found the weight of ſo ſparkling a heaven very eaſie and ſupportable: they were called but to give a hand, and they have thruſt ſo far in as to lend a ſhoulder for ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burden of that Great Machine.</p>
               <p>The Popes, who are often elected in ſo great an age, or of ſo weak a conſtitution, that they can have no other thoughts but to ſpend the reſt of their dayes in quiet, are eaſily inclined to leave the management of affairs to thoſe that are neareſt them, in proſpect that theſe imployments make a ſettlement for their families, and procure them alliances, not onely with all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick perſons, but likewiſe with the Princes and Soverains of all Chriſtendom, whom they may oblige.</p>
               <p>The charges of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44266:59"/>amongſt the Kindred of the Pope; the Seculars commonly divide amongſt them the Government of the Eccleſiaſtick State; the neareſt and deareſt Relation will be made General of the Holy Church; another, Governour of the Caſtle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo;</hi> another, General of the Galleys and of the Navy; and ſo charges are given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are more or leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe who are differently favoured and eſteemed.</p>
               <p>But, the moſt important Office is that of Cardinal Nephew, or Cardinal Regnant: he it is that makes the fortune of the other Relations; he is alwayes where the Pope is, if we had not rather ſay, that the Pope is alwayes where the Nephew is: he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of him abſolutely: nothing moves in the Palace but by his order, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Officers of the Palace, or of thoſe that are abroad: he is the head in all Counſels, preſent at all Congregations; he regulates the dayes of the Conſiſtories, of the Chappels, Viſits, and Audiences: and, in a word, it is on him that the Pope relies in all matters.</p>
               <p>In ſo much that the Nephew of a Pope had need of a great ſufficiency, wiſely to manage all Affairs.</p>
               <p>But, there is nothing more eſſential to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44266:60"/>his conduct, than to be able to take right meaſures with the Miniſters of Crowns and Princes: it is that which makes the glory of a Pontificat, all the honour of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, all the Grandeur and Joy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and very often the repoſe of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſhould reflect on the reign of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Popes in theſe laſt ages, we would find the truth of this verified: we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome Pontificats full of ſplendour and glory, and others buried in obſcurity and lowneſs, ſome in an amiable tranquillity, calme, and peace; others in troubleſome broiles, diſturbances, and continual diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: and if we inquire into the cauſe of this, we ſhall find, that all depends on the genius of the Nephews Regnant, and their particular conduct with Princes.</p>
               <p>It is really difficult for a Popes Nephew to be able to obſerve alwayes juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with ſo many Miniſters of a different humour, who have ſuch different intereſts, who live at <hi>Rome</hi> in continual jealouſies, and who labour alwayes to draw ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the Holy See, by any way whatſoever, either in rendring themſelves uſeful, or in ſetting themſelves off more than others.</p>
               <p>There is no Catholick Prince but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44266:60"/>at <hi>Rome,</hi> either an Ambaſſadour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, or ſome Agent; and though their obedience and reſpect engaged them not to maintain as much as may be, a good correſpondence with the common Father, yet they would in policy be obliged to do it, that they may in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the intereſts of the Clergy and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which make a conſiderable part of their States, and ſupport the affairs which daily happen amongſt their Subjects in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>This is not the place to examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Soveraigns in that Court; or to compare them together, that we may judge of the conduct of the Miniſters that are entruſted with them; that alone would make a Book big enough. I onely ſay, that of all that are employed for the affairs of Countries ſubmitted to the Holy See, there are none that make any conſiderable ſigure, in reſpect of the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour commonly is ſatisfied with a Protector for the propoſition of Churches; and if he have any urgent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be propoſed to his Holineſs, he does it either by the Miniſtery of a Cardinal, or by ſome Envoy Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poland</hi> obſerves the ſame Maxim; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44266:61"/>teſtifies either ſo much obedience, or ſo much indifferency, as to all that paſſes at <hi>Rome;</hi> that the King does not ſo much as name Cardinals of his Nation, though he might in his turn take the ſame courſe as other Crowns do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Portugal</hi> keeps there for the moſt part a Reſident; and ſince the Pope was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to own the ſeparation of that State from <hi>Spain,</hi> there have been but two Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from <hi>Portugal,</hi> who vaniſhed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as they appeared.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Venice</hi> cultivates moſt the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and next the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> but more becauſe of the vicinity of their countreys, than the importance of affairs that they have there to manage.</p>
               <p>So that, we may ſay, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are the two onely crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads, who concern themſelves in good earneſt in the affairs of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with this difference; that the moſt Chriſtian King acts with <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Friend, who has no other obligation on him but that of civility and complaiſance, by reaſon of the liberties and immunities of the Church of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When on the other hand his Cathololick
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44266:61"/>Majeſty carries it with <hi>Rome</hi> as an intereſted Aſſociate, becauſe he is cloſely tied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to it by the Tribunal of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and by the Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction, which gives abſolute authority to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's and Judges of the Church, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole extent of his Dominions.</p>
               <p>And that is the reaſon that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Rome</hi> exceed not a kind of dryneſs that often happens amongſt Friends upon occaſion of ſome grudge, and which commonly yields to the pleaſure of a reconciliation. On the contrary, <hi>Spain</hi> either never breaks with <hi>Rome,</hi> or their ruptures are attended with ſome great blow and noiſe, as happens betwixt perſons intereſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that the Jealouſies of theſe two Kings, has ſome Analogie with that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> theſe two children endeavoured who could moſt, to attract all the Bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> their Father, they made uſe of all kind of artifice to ſupplant one another, and to make their condition bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And the Pope is in no leſs perplexity than the good old man <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, how to content his two children. I will not enter upon the full application of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: it muſt not be ſaid that this common
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44266:62"/>Father is ſo dim-ſighted as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, that he cannot diſtinguiſh the Merit of theſe two Sons; that he knows not him to whom God has deſigned the birth-right; that he perceives not for which of the two it is, that their Mother has greateſt ſympathie and inclination; that is, whom the Church has cheriſhed moſt, and to whom ſhe hath alwayes given the preference: the Pope needs not to feel the hands of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he may know him from <hi>Eſau,</hi> he knows it ſufficiently by many brave actions, from which the holy See has drawn moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantages: he knows very well for whom he ought to declare himſelf, and to whom he ought to give the greater ſhare of his bleſſings. But the good Father fears to foment Jealouſies, and to put diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his two ſons by an open Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is a figure of what daily happens at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Pope can do nothing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or conſideration of <hi>France,</hi> but that he is burdened with the complaints of <hi>Spain:</hi> And ſeeing the Catholick King is ſtronger in <hi>Italy,</hi> than his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, by reaſon of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Duchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> ſo has he a better ſhare of the bleſſings of the Earth, though with reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy Father; that is to ſay, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44266:62"/>carries it by politick intereſt, and the Pope muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though he be <hi>French</hi> in his heart.</p>
               <p>We might likewiſe add that <hi>Eſau</hi> was more uſeful to <hi>Iſaack</hi> than <hi>Jacob;</hi> that he brought his Father daily ſome prey from Hunting; that he laboured to ſatisfie the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the old man; whilſt <hi>Jacob</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up about the affairs of his Family, and looking after his Flocks, without with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the boſom, or ſight of his Mother: So the King of <hi>Spain</hi> daily obliges the Pope by great ſums of Money, which <hi>Rome</hi> draws out of his Dominions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>French</hi> King hath no other aim but to pleaſe the Church, to aſſiſt her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to extend and increaſe the number of her ſubjects, and in fine, to maintain the Family that depends thereon.</p>
               <p>Having caſt an eye upon theſe reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may be eaſily judged, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Nephew of a Pope ought to order his Conduct with the Miniſters of Crowns.</p>
               <p>He may lay down for maxims, that the intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> is founded on Intereſt and Fear, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ask any thing which is not to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; that they uſe endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſame liberties as <hi>France</hi> hath; that they cannot attain to that, without ſhaking
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44266:63"/>off the yoke of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, which they have ſo often attempted; that moſt part of their demands are hurtful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes; and that by conſequence, nothing is to be granted to them, unleſs it be firſt well conſidered, if any prejudice may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound from it, to the authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick See.</p>
               <p>That on the other hand, the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no other foundation than love and reſpect; that their liberties, immunities, and priviledges, put them in a condition of not having moſt times their recourſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> but purely out of deference and reſpect; that theſe liberties free their demands from the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of abuſe or noveltie; and that if the King or his Subjects make application to the Holy See; there is commonly more to be got, by granting, than by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their demands, becauſe, that in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they make matters paſs for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which otherwiſe they pretend to have by juſtice, when they come with any reluctancy.</p>
               <p>That other Princes in imitation of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> do all they can to enlarge their liberties, and eſpecially the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with whom cloſer meaſures may be taken, becauſe they are in greater dependence on the Holy See.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:44266:63"/>
               <p>It would he no hard matter for me to ſhow in the ſequel of this Hiſtory, that theſe maxims are very eſſential for the conduct of affairs in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but I have confined my ſelf to the affairs of the preſent Pontificat.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee then what meaſures Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> has taken in his Miniſtry with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>He had great advantages for ſucceeding in it, he was become Nephew to a very aged Pope, of a mild and commodious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, eaſie to be governed: he had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a glorious and wiſe Pontificat, under <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. who made it queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether he was more <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> but who left no doubt but that he was all to all: the private intereſt of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment buſied him not much, ſeeing the faireſt Dignities ſhowred down upon his head, and the beſt bits fell into his mouth, as the Pamerlengat, and great Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> with many conſiderable benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the death of the Cardinals <hi>Ginetti,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Barbarini,</hi> beſides the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> wherewith the Pope provided him, at the opening of the Conclave. There was none at Court able to give him jealouſie, or to thwart his projects; the death of Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> left him quickly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44266:64"/>maſter of <hi>Rome;</hi> Cardinal <hi>Eſte,</hi> who alone could give the Popes Nephews enough to do, was retired home to <hi>Modena,</hi> where in a ſhort time he ended his troubles with his days; Cardinal <hi>Gabrieli</hi> was removed, as we have ſaid before; the alliance of his Houſe ſtrengthened his authority; and none were in the Palace but his own Creatures. There were no great affairs in agitation at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Miniſtry of the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Catholick crowned Heads was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by Prelats, to wit, by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> and Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> Chriſtian Princes were in peace the two firſt years of his Miniſtry, except the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in war with the <hi>Turk;</hi> and if the King of <hi>France</hi> was then thinking of a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> it was the faireſt conjuncture in the world for the Nephew of a Pope, to immortalize the memory of the Pontificat, by rendring it advantageous to the Church, and happy for Catholicks: and he had occaſion enough to pleaſe many men, by the frequent vacancies of ſo many places in the ſacred Colledge.</p>
               <p>Here was a fair field to reap in; who does not now expect honourable Legations for Chriſtian Leagues, and Croiſado's?</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:44266:64"/>
               <p>But that is the leaſt thing in the thoughts of Cardinal <hi>Altieri;</hi> he was obſerved from the very beginning, to be very little addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to affairs abroad, which be remitted wholly almoſt to the cares of Cardinal <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Borromei,</hi> then Secretary of State. He only applyed himſelf to the building of a ſumptuous Palace in <hi>Iſola,</hi> to procure rich Furniture for it, and to manage intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at <hi>Rome</hi> for Marriages, Charges, and other ſmall affairs that concerned either the Palace, or the Eccleſiaſtick State.</p>
               <p>Nothing that is great, was to be ſeen in his Projects, nothing high in his Conduct.</p>
               <p>Some were pleaſed to ſay, that he was but as yet a Novice in forreign affairs; that he had no experience in the Courts, and intereſts of Princes; that he had not advanced to the Sovereign power by Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatures and Legations; that he became Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, by buying the place of Auditor of the Chamber; that he was made Nephew by a Caprice of fortune, and that ſo he could not acquire a perfect knowledge of what is fit to be known, for entring into commerce with Crowns; that it behoved him to wait till buſineſs formed him, and rendred him capable of greater matters.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:44266:65"/>
               <p>Others to excuſe him, gave it out that Cardinal <hi>Borromei</hi> endeavoured ſecretly to diſcredit him with the Pope and Sovereigns, that ſo he might render himſelf more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Church, and gain the good Will and Liking of forreign Princes; that <hi>Borromei</hi> eaſily engaged the Pope in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he knew were not agreeable to <hi>Altieri,</hi> to draw upon him the diſpleaſure of Princes, by the repugnancy that he would ſhew, when the matter was of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Holineſs pleaſure in execution; that he laid the blame of all the diſſicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Miniſters met with at the Palace, in proſecution of their Maſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs upon the Nephew; that Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> perceived it, but that he choſe rather to be a publick ſacrifice, than to diſpleaſe the Pope, by open reſentments againſt <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romei,</hi> for whom his Holineſs had eſteem and friendſhip: and by ſuch diſcourſes they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his conduct.</p>
               <p>Some there were, that would have had the indifferency of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> paſs for a politick Fetch: they ſaid that <hi>Rome</hi> uſed firſt to be ſollicited, before it medled in the affairs of Princes; that <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. found the benefit of following that maxime, <hi>(Che il mondo ſi governa da ſe;)</hi> that the world ſhould govern it ſelf, and that the only
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44266:65"/>way is to let it goe as it goes; what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were to be taken with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Government of a Regent, a Pupil, and ſeveral Miniſters, who had not too good intelligence among themſelves? what was to be done with the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, unleſs it were to attract the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of all other Chriſtian Princes, who could not already endure his too great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? In a word, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> could gain nothing with Potentates when they prevented them; that on the contrary they would make their advantage with them by valuing dear their correſpondence to the deſires of his Holineſs; as they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances on ſeveral occaſions, where the Holy See had always remitted of its Rights and Authority, by Indulgences, Favours, and priviledges, which it had been obliged to grant to ſeveral Princes.</p>
               <p>So that he did very well not to meddle in the intereſts and affairs of Princes.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak the truth, theſe reflexions had but little force with knowing men, to juſtifie the honour of <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, though he had not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the employments which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for the management of forreign affairs, yet it is known that the <hi>Italian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has naturally a great talent for Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44266:66"/>and that they wonderfully ſucceed in it, provided they apply themſelves a little thereunto: other Nephews have been known young enough, who left a glorious memory of their Miniſtry, and who had with honor diſpatched greateſt affairs in moſt troubleſome times, as the <hi>Farneſe</hi>'s, the <hi>Borromei's, Aldobrandini's, Borgheſes,</hi> and the <hi>Barberini's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what was ſaid of Cardinal <hi>Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> Secretary of State; it is certain, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> had no much liking to him, perhaps, becauſe he was a man of too great merit, that he alone clouded him with the Pope, and was the only perſon in whom his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs put greateſt confidence, as he had ſufficiently teſtified, by honouring him with the charge of Secretary of State, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after with a Cardinals Hat: but however <hi>Borromei</hi> was a Miniſter ſubordinate to the Nephew, without whom, by conſequence, he could do or act nothing; and matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad going ill, the fault would be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to none but the chief mover; beſides, ſince the death of <hi>Borromei,</hi> matters are gone far worſe than before.</p>
               <p>As to the Romiſh maxime, of letting the world goe as it goes, and the riſque that the Holy See runs, of loſing rather than gaining, when that Court entangles
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44266:66"/>it ſelf in the affairs of Princes, many things might be ſaid, but it is ſufficient at preſent to averr openly, that that maxim is low and unworthy of a Univerſal Biſhop, who by that very name is obliged to take care of the neceſſities of Chriſtendom; that it is a pernicious maxime, introduced only by thoſe, or for thoſe, who mind nothing in the Papacy, but that which flatters Vanity, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, and Senſualitie: that it is prophane, and for thoſe only, of whom the Royal Prophet ſpeaks with diſdain, <hi>in laboribus hominum non ſunt;</hi> who avoid taking a ſhare in the labour and care, to which humane ſtate is obnoxious; that the Holy See never proſpered ſo well, as with Emperors and Kings, to whom it hath had its recourſe; whence came the Patrimony of <hi>St. Peter?</hi> from whence the Hexarchat of <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Romania?</hi> from whence all the Lands and Territories of the Eccleſiaſtick State? from whence, in a word, the maintaining of the obedience, and homage rendred to the Church? if not from their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and good intelligence with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes? what have the Popes ever given them of theirs? What have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs ever demanded of them, unleſs it be ſome indults for providing and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Benefices of their Dominions?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44266:67"/>Some Tithes for the preſſing neceſſities of Religion? Some Indulgences for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their people? But what Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are better filled than thoſe to which theſe Princes preſent? What Money bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed than what has been granted them upon the Rents of the Church? And what Spiritual Treaſures better beſtowed, than what has been given to people who have ſo much reſpect and veneration for Holy things? ſo that all theſe ſhadows diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing, and theſe pretexts ceaſing in the Nephew of a Pope, and eſpecially as to Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> it was concluded that for great affairs his Talent was not great; that all his ambition was confined to the making of his Family by Romiſh Intrigues; and that he had no ſtomach as the Spaniards ſay, <hi>Por digerir los boccones grandes,</hi> to digeſt great pieces.</p>
               <p>In effect, if we impartially conſider, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he hath let ſlip ſo many fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſignalizing himſelf, or that he has brought upon himſelf ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky hits, without thinking on them; we may eaſily judge, that he hath been as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different for the one, as improvident againſt the others. Let us ſee then both the chief opportunities of renoun, which he hath fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to embrace; and the occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44266:67"/>and perplexity, into which he hath thrown himſelf, that we may make good a truth which will juſtifie a great many, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing wrong to his conduct.</p>
               <p>We muſt lay down for a ground then, the ſtate of the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that Pontificat, to wit, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at peace together, the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Turk againſt <hi>Poland;</hi> and the preparations of <hi>France</hi> againſt <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What projects might Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> have had in that conjuncture? or rather what might he not have undertaken? if the matter was to aſſiſt <hi>Poland</hi> againſt the Turk; what means were wanting to him, Peace being between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain?</hi> or if that peace ſeemed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt by ſome clouds of jealouſies and fears, there was no difficulty to confirm a ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all the climats of Chriſtendom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe clouds gathered more, and grew thicker, and before they broke out in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning in many places of the world, as ſince they have done.</p>
               <p>What advances did he make for the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Poland?</hi> what Legations for the union of Chriſtian Princes? what Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make them turn their Arms againſt the Common Enemy? he made no other ſtep, than the raiſing of vaſt ſums of Money
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44266:68"/>of the Benefices of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereof he very ſlowly ſent to the Republick of <hi>Poland,</hi> Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Crowns. A Cardinal of great virtue, ſcandalized at the lukewarmneſs of <hi>Altieri,</hi> ſent him a conſiderable ſum of his own Money to awaken him, and to excite him to make ſome brisk attempt, in favour of a Kingdom expoſed as a prey to Infidels; but that ſecret reproof of backwardneſs, made no great impreſſion on him. <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz</hi> was already carried by the Turks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poles were in any condition to make head againſt them; and to compleat their misfortunes, King <hi>Michael</hi> being dead, the Kingdom was divided about the election of a ſucceſſor to the Crown. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> beſtirred himſelf a little, but at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to the end he might back the deſigns of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who were for Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> his ſucceeding to the Crown, in hopes of making him marry the Queen Dowager of <hi>Poland,</hi> Siſter to the Emperor; He cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great offers to be made of Money and aſſiſtance, that he might overcome the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which the <hi>Poles</hi> might make, by reaſon of the lowneſs of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> as to fortune; who depended in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and who was not like to have means of ſupporting the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44266:68"/>Crown under the preſſing Circumſtances i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lay under. Monſieur <hi>Bonvizi</hi> the Nuncio, was the life of his deſignes in <hi>Poland,</hi> as he had formerly been at <hi>Cologne:</hi> that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late who has been always reputed to have a great Heart and ſmall Head, was as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſleſs in the one place, as he had been in the other; there was but little regard had for the Packt-Offices of <hi>Rome:</hi> the Nuncio's propoſition was laid aſide, and <hi>John Sobieſki</hi> was choſe a King, a man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to maintain the Crown, both by his conſummated prudence, and Heroick cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>So that the whole Intrigue was uſeleſs, and ſerved only to diſgrace the Holy See, in the perſon of <hi>Altieri,</hi> to beget an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſeveral Princes concerned in that Declaration, and to expoſe his Miniſtry to the compaſſion of his friends, and to the deriſion and hatred of his adverſaries.</p>
               <p>In truth, if we ſhould enlarge in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon that Conduct, his meaſures would ſeem very obſcure: what obliged him in an affair of that conſequence, to tranſgreſs the bounds of Neutrality, which renders the Pope alike venerable to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which makes him Umpire amongſt all Chriſtian Princes; and which places him in the midſt of Sovereigns, as the Sun
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44266:69"/>is among the Planets, to give impartially his light to all the celeſtial bodies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they draw near, or are at diſtance from him, for the different participation thereof?</p>
               <p>Or if he had a mind to leave that neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality to gain a Crowned Head, why did he not aſſure himſelf well firſt of the ſucceſs of his enterprize? it is true, if it had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, it would have been of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him; but he had but few inſtances of free people, that have ever been willing to accept of a King from the hands of Popes. If they have ſometimes given Kings to the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> they had the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Dominion; but he had leſs reaſon to promiſe himſelf that from the Republick of <hi>Poland,</hi> which profeſſes a liberty ſo nice, that it will not ſo much as accept of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of that Nation from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that Dignity puts them on a dependence on forreign Princes.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch, that they who otherwiſe know the humor of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry undertaking, and that he is more ready to Ward than make a Paſs, could find no other cauſe of that procedure, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive compliance with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> wherein he may have this comfort, that he is not the only Miniſter or Kinſman of a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44266:69"/>Pope, who hath been out of his meaſures, in following too implicitely the counſels of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the election of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> one may imagine that that Prince had but little obligation to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſpecially to Cardinal <hi>Altieri;</hi> ſo that it was rationally to be believed, that this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew in good policie, yea, even in civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>decorum,</hi> would take all ways to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good Will of a Sovereign, who had ſome reaſon not to be well ſatisfied with him, becauſe his Faction was againſt him in the Diet,</p>
               <p>His Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> gave him a fair opportunity for this; by naming the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to a Cardinalſhip, who would not be perſwaded that there ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be diſpatched a Gentleman of his Holineſs's, or Cardinal <hi>Altier</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to carry a Cardinals Hat to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> or be diſpoſed of by him, as he thought beſt, that by ſuch a courteous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage he might gain the favours of ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Prince, and ſo uſeful as the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is, in a State where there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions about matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>But Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi>'s eyes are ſtill ſhut, he cannot but liſten to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> they make him believe that the election of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44266:70"/>
                  <hi>Sobieski</hi> to be King of <hi>Poland,</hi> cannot ſubſiſt; that it was not formal, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and precipitancy hath more concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it, than mature deliberation; that it will meet with oppoſition; that thoſe of <hi>Lithuania</hi> have not given their conſent thereto: that that Prince is married, and that the Republick will have a Lord that may marry the Queen Dowager of <hi>Poland;</hi> that the <hi>Poles</hi> are ſtill doubtful whether that election will ſtand good; that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themſelves; and that they may every minute change their reſolution: theſe were the amuſements, whereof the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made uſe in general, to diſſwade Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> from complying with the new King of <hi>Poland:</hi> and as to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the nomination of the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> they inſinuate to him, that <hi>France</hi> endeavours to get into the poſſeſſion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cardinals at their devotion, by the nomination of, forreign Crowns; that he is obliged in intereſt to oppoſe ſuch an abuſe; that the Pope ought to obſerve an equality betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> that the Catholick King will have ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended, if by ſuch ways <hi>French</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals be daily made at <hi>Rome;</hi> that <hi>Poland</hi> may be ſatisfied, that the promotion of Cardinal <hi>Bonzi</hi> has been ſuffered to paſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44266:70"/>without obſtruction; that if the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> be made Cardinal, <hi>Spain</hi> will pretend to the ſame Compenſation as in the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Laon;</hi> that is, that they muſt likewiſe have a Cardinal; that nevertheleſs, to ſatisfie the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not to reject his propoſal, he might willingly accept the nomination for any other perſon his Majeſty pleaſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a Frenchman.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> eaſily embraced the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Counſel, he had a great inclination for them; and though the Biſhop of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi> in his journey into <hi>Italy,</hi> (whither the King had ſent him, to endeavor an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation betwixt the great Ducheſs of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and the great Duke her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) made a progreſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> and by his good qualities left favourable impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his fortune; nevertheleſs he had the ill luck to have been named by a King for whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no liking; in a time when the Nephew Regnant was in very bad correſpondence with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>France,</hi> and in a conjuncture when Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> Protector of <hi>Poland,</hi> was not in too much credit at the Palace, becauſe he had engaged in the Intrigues of the Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:44266:71"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Altieri</hi> then took the courſe the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had propoſed to him; he wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Brief to his Holineſs, in which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accepted of his nomination, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to afford his Holineſs the means of giving him content, as it was his purpoſe and deſire to do, without mentioning the cauſe that oppoſed the fulfilling of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as to the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> to theſe Letters he added private Inſtructions to the Nuncio, that he ſhould acquaint the King, that the Jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was an impediment to the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> that his Majeſty would oblige his Holineſs, if he would caſt his eyes upon ſome Neutral Perſon, with whom all parties might be ſatisfied; that that condeſcention would ſtill engage his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to uſe endeavors for the eaſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> from the preſſures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it lay.</p>
               <p>The King was very ill pleaſed at the way how the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed him: it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrange to him how theſe men, who ſet alwayes to work to advance another to the Crown, ſhould have ſtill the Countenance to refuſe him a Hat at the inſtigation of thoſe who were jealous of his greatneſs; that they had the baſeneſs to barter and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44266:71"/>truck with him by ſelfiſh propoſitions below the greatneſs of his mind, as well as the dignity of the Apoſtolick See: that they ſhould take the liberty to contradict the choice he had made of one who was very dear unto him upon many conſiderations, and who ought to be more ſo to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by his merit and virtue. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remained conſtant in the Nomination of the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> and <hi>Altieri</hi> to this preſent has forborn as much as he could, to give him that reaſonable ſatisfaction, by protracting the promotion of Crowns.</p>
               <p>There has been nothing conſpicuous in all this conduct of <hi>Altieri</hi> with <hi>Poland,</hi> but a paſſion to content the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or at leaſt a deſire not to diſpleaſe them; and though that has ſome colour in the eyes of thoſe who endeavour to excuſe him, ſaying, It is impoſſible for a Popes Nephew to preſerve the favour of all parties; that it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to adhere to the chief branches of the Tree, and to keep himſelf in good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with <hi>Spain,</hi> who have more means of offending, and leſs facility to forget and pardon: yet more quaint Politicians could have given a counſel, whereby <hi>Altieri</hi> might have had the advantage, of contenting his Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> without offending the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that is, to have perſwaded
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44266:72"/>the Pope to have prevented the demand of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> upon his aſſumption to the Crown, by offering him a Hat, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in favours of whom he pleaſed: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have had nothing to ſay againſt that engagement; and then if the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had named the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> their mouthes would have been ſtopped, by telling them, that the Pope could not excuſe himſelf from fulfilling what he had abſolutely promiſed, not foreſeeing that his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> would nominate the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, at <hi>Rome,</hi> they want not skill to find out biaſſes, when they have a mind to do things with good grace; nor excuſes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they have any reluctancy: and as to what is ſaid, touching the difficulty that the Nephew of a Pope meets with, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving content to all parties, I could make appear, that there is nothing more eaſie for an impartial and unprejudiced Nephew, whereof we have freſh inſtances in the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat of <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Relations.</p>
               <p>We ſhall leave it to the World to Judge of the whole piece by this Pattern, and to time to diſcover the bad texture of it; that we may proceed to make reflexions on ſome other occaſions, wherein that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44266:72"/>Nephew might have made appear his zeal and wiſdom, and by illuſtrious actions, have raiſed the glory of his Unckles Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the honour of his own Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>There was no man but knew what great preparations the <hi>French</hi> King made for a War againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that he might endeavour to reduce that Republick to their natural duty, of acknowledging, that in part it holds of his Crown, both the ground of its liberty, and the eſtabliſhment of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. It is likewiſe known, that with the ſame hand the King would reſtore the liberty of the Catholick Religion, in a Countrey where it is had in horrour.</p>
               <p>In fine, the effects of this was ſhortly ſeen, by a great many Churches reconſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both in the Towns and Countrey of four Provinces, conquered within the ſpace of a few weeks.</p>
               <p>All Catholicks triumphed at the progreſs of the moſt Chriſtian Kings Arms; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gave publick thanks to Heaven for the ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>What is it Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> will not do, to give marks of his Joy and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? What honour will accrue to his Miniſtery, and his Unckles Pontificat, when ſucceeding ages ſhall ſee in the Annalls, <hi>Holland</hi> reduced to the obedience of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44266:73"/>Holy See, or at leaſt the liberty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reeſtabliſhed under Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the X, and the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo ſenſibly enlarged under the reign of <hi>Altieri?</hi> What Feſtivals, What Publick Rejoycings, What Inſcriptions, What Medals, to render ſuch actions immortal? if Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth left engraven on Medalls the Victory of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi> which coſt ſo much to the Holy See and to all Chriſtendom, without much fruit: What will not <hi>Clement</hi> the X. do, for the ſwift courſe of ſo many Victories with ſo little blood, attended with conſiderable advantages? If <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth filled <hi>Rome</hi> with Marbles, which carried the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the return of <hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſome of the Church; What ought not <hi>Clement</hi> the Tenth to do for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Holland?</hi> If Pope <hi>Barbarini</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged the Ocean into a Baſon, in form of a Bark, which he cauſed to be made at the foot of Mount <hi>Pincius,</hi> where ſtands a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>French Minims,</hi> in memory of the taking of <hi>Rochel;</hi> What Illuſtrious Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not Pope <hi>Altieri</hi> leave to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not for one ſingle Town, but for ſo many conquered Provinces? In fine, if Popes, in conjunctures of leſs importance and glory, have contributed to their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for the maintaining of armes, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44266:73"/>they thought Religion therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; either in furniſhing of men and Money; or elſe by Legations, wherein they employed Prelates of greateſt worth: if their Nephews have abandoned their own intereſts, if they have gone themſelves in perſon; What efforts are there not to be expected from Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the progreſs of <hi>Holland?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us obſerve his conduct. In the year 1671, the moſt Chriſtian King ſends the Abbot <hi>Bardi-magalotti</hi> to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to treat with them about the raiſing of an <hi>Italian</hi> Regiment, to be entertained by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty amongſt his foreign Forces: I might ſay ſomewhat of the different diſpoſitions he found ſeveral Princes in, according as they ſtood vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected towards that propoſition, led by the Maximes of a Countrey, where Sovereigns are obliged to be cautious in their meaſures for preſerving their liberty, without offending of thoſe who are more powerful than themſelves.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall handle that at length in a ſeparate treaty. The Abbot <hi>Bardi</hi> without doubt might expect any thing of Cardinal <hi>Altieri;</hi> he could not be ignorant of the deſign theſe Forces were to be employed in; and what ſecrecie ſoever was obſerved in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44266:74"/>the Kings Counſils, yet all <hi>Italy</hi> was already filled with a rumour, that the cloud that was a gathering would break out upon <hi>Holland.</hi> Nevertheleſs he had the greateſt difficulty in the world to obtain leave to leavie men in the Eccleſiaſtick State; nor was it granted but on moſt diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conditions, becauſe no Tradeſman, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Journey-man, could be liſted, nor were Drums to be beaten up. So that there remained none to be liſted but Vagabonds, who might ſafely run away, after they had taken the Kings Money, the Authority of the King having no force there: the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> following the example of <hi>Rome;</hi> and having ſuffered the Levies to be made within their States, upon the ſame and no other conditions, it is no wonder if <hi>Italy</hi> was quickly full of deſerters, and that they who remained, did afterward ſo little honour to their <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From that very time it was perceived, that with reluctancy he concurred with the deſigns of the King, ſo far from ſhewing himſelf forward to ſecond them; and that the Jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prevailed more on him, than all the conſiderations of the glory and advantage of the Holy See. I wave the artifices that were employed to diſſwade many Gentlemen, who on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44266:74"/>would have been willing to have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their apprentiſhip in the trade of War under ſuch a King; ſome of whom I know and could name.</p>
               <p>But let us trace the Politicks of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri:</hi> perhaps he hath done nothing hitherto, becauſe he knew not where all the preparations of the War were to be employed; he is to be excuſed, the King conceales his projects, all Soveraigns are in ſuſpence expecting the iſſue. Who knows but theſe numerous Forces may paſs the <hi>Alpes?</hi> if that Fleet may not bend its courſe towards <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be he reſerves himſelf to make ſome generous declaration, when he ſhall ſee the King march againſt <hi>Holland;</hi> when he ſhall underſtand that he cauſes Churches to be opened and conſecrated in ſo many conquered places; when he ſhall be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Eccleſiaſtick Princes are reſtored to their States, which were uſurped by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Republick: then ſome ſignal mark of reſentment is to be expected from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome great teſtimony of correſpondence with the actions of a Monarch, that labours more for the Church than for himſelf.</p>
               <p>In a ſmall time they had the news at <hi>Rome</hi> of all that I have ſaid of the progreſs
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44266:75"/>of the French Forces, but nothing of what might have been expected from Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> appeares: The French Ambaſſador daily carried him the news of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and he ſeemed inſenſible at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good fortune of all Catholicks: he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the Waters made way to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were buried in them; that the enemies fled before the face of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and he was either deaf or dumb, as to Songs of Joy, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Thankſgivings.</p>
               <p>He ſtops not there, he cannot diſguiſe his ſecret reluctancy to the advices he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of ſo many Victories; he leſſens the glory of them as much as poſſibly he can: and had he had power over the ſame that was publiſhed by all mouths, he would have condemned it to perpetual ſilence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are no exaggerations; they are real truths, all the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf knew what happened one day, when he was told of the paſſage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and of the brave exploits that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, and followed that famous action, He threw it away as a <hi>Grecian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and would not believe one word of it: He ſaid publickly that there was no ſuch thing; and that he had better intelligence how affairs went. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44266:75"/>was offended at this obſtinacy: A Miniſter of that quality is obliged to make good what he ſays: and ſeeing his ſteps are well obſerved, eſpecially at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo ought he to take good heed how he walkes: it would be a diſhonour to his Character to give out any thing that muſt be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not ſo ſcrupulous in ſuch matters, witneſs the news that Cardinal <hi>Nitard</hi> a few Moneths agoe brought to the Palace, of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Victory obtained by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>It behoved then the Duke <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> to know of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> himſelf, from whence he could have news contrary to what he had told. <hi>Altieri</hi> was in a puzle: on the one ſide he was unwilling to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a little commerce that he entertained with <hi>Bonviſi,</hi> at that time Nuncio at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne:</hi> on the other ſide, he muſt ſatisfie the Ambaſſador at <hi>France,</hi> who complained, that there was ſo little eſteem teſtified for actions that were ſo advantageous to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and, Who would have made appear his Reſentments, if he had not had the ſatisfaction which he juſtly pretended to have: In ſo much, that <hi>Altieri</hi> was obliged to ſhow him a Letter of the Nuncio <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſi,</hi> by which was diſcovered their Plot,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44266:76"/>and little Intrigue, to leſſen the Reputation of the Kings actions, and to put off the publick Rejoycings: that Letter came not into the hands of any man, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it was known; it ſpake not of the particular actions of the times, but onely bore, that all that was publiſhed of the Grandeurs of <hi>France,</hi> was not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; that his Conqueſts commonly would but prove a blaze of Straw, and that there was not much to be built upon them; that all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> began already to ſtir; that the King of <hi>England</hi> would withdraw; that <hi>Spain</hi> and the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire would unite, and that ſo all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes of the moſt Chriſtian King were like to turn to ſmoak. This Letter of <hi>Bonviſi</hi> made the Sentiments of <hi>Altieri</hi> apparent enough, becauſe a Miniſter at a diſtance from his Maſter, makes it his whole ſtudy to ſecond his thoughts, but that appeared more clearly afterward; for <hi>Bonviſi</hi> finding himſelf charged by <hi>Altieri,</hi> was conſtrained, for his own Juſtification, to ſay, that he did nothing but by his order, and direction.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the actions of the moſt Chriſtian King, eſpecially in the firſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> will hardly be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in future ages: but it will be ſtill more incredible that the Nephew of a Pope
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44266:76"/>hath been ſo inſenſible of the great good that redounded therefrom to the Holy See, that he would receive the news with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, nay even with reluctancy; that he ſuffered it to be ſaid in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Popes Palace was Dutchified, for that was the word all the Town over; though it did not in the leaſt move him, becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf that he gave ground for ſuch a report; that he was not ſenſible of his own, nor of his Unckles honour; that he had ſacrificed it to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were Jealous of the greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi> Some excuſed him upon the account of the bad intelligence that was betwixt him and the Duke <hi>d'Eſtree,</hi> they ſaid, that theſe two did what they could to ſerve one another daily ſome trick, as a mark of their ſpight. But, What policy is there in that, not to diſtinguiſh the private averſion that one hath for a Miniſter, from the obligation that is due to the Maſter whom he ſerves? Would he not have done far better both for the Pope and himſelf, to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an intelligence with the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, notwithſtanding all the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents that he pretended to receive from the Ambaſſadour? Was not that a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful means to have thrown the wrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Ambaſſadour himſelf, which has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44266:77"/>with other Nephews, when they had any variance with his Majeſties Miniſters.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged then, that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altieri</hi> hath ſhewn but very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in drawing advantage from the War in <hi>Holland;</hi> and far leſs zeal for the glory of the Pontificate, and of his own reign; of which no cauſe can be given but a too great deference to the ſentiments or <hi>Spain,</hi> and an intire dependency of its Miniſters, which have made him forget the part of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he repreſents, that he may act theirs, to the expence of his honour, and perhaps of his repoſe.</p>
               <p>This likewiſe hath made him let ſlip ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conjuncture, wherein he might have ſignalized himſelf as much, as in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>It is known, that after the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages gained on <hi>Holland,</hi> it was an eaſie matter to have hindered the fire from ſpreading, as it hath done ſince amongſt moſt of Chriſtian Princes: the King of <hi>France,</hi> though encouraged by ſo much fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſucceſs, was ſtill ſo much Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to put a ſtop to the carriere of his Victories: he had enough in his hands to do himſelf and his Allies Juſtice, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down thoſe that had provoked him: the United Provinces would have willingly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44266:77"/>conſented to it, <hi>England</hi> had withdrawn; the Princes of the Empire ſaw nothing to be got by a rupture, what Jealouſie ſoever they had of the neighbourhood of the French Forces.</p>
               <p>The Soveraigns ſtood looking at one another, there was time enough to have brought them to an accommodation, the queſtion was onely to find a Mediator: None durſt be the firſt to break and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; at <hi>Rome</hi> the Miniſters of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the moſt Chriſtian and Catholick Kings were obſerved to confer together at the breaking up of Chappels, and other Aſſemblies where they were; In the mean time it was publickly talked at the Palace, that the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> was to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that the Emperor, Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were ready to declare War: but that delayed a long time, and it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they expected ſome Umpire to make them Friends.</p>
               <p>How happy an occaſion for the Nephew of a Pope to beſtir himſelf for peace! Were not Nuncio's extraordinary, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats to be expected then abroad? the <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandini</hi> and <hi>Barbarini,</hi> forſook their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intereſts for Reconciliations of leſs conſequence; they have been ſeen paſs Seas and Mountains for affairs leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44266:78"/>to Chriſtendom: not to ſpeak of other Nephews, and of <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves, who have teſtified zeal for the Union of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes. What advantage would it have been to have hindered that rupture before it broke forth? the exerciſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion remained free in <hi>Holland,</hi> at leaſt in the Provinces where it was already reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Arms of the French King would be turned againſt the <hi>Turks; Poland</hi> would be ſecured from the Invaſion of Infidels: In a word, all people would have enjoyed the tranquillity which ſince they have loſt.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> makes no reflexion on all theſe things; all his Intrigues at that time were confined to a ſecond Marriage for his Family. He would once more nave the Duke of <hi>Anticoli</hi> Marry a Maid of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all his care is taken up in building of a Palace, whoſe Magnificence obſcures one of the ſtatelieſt Churches in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a more powerful cauſe than this wrought upon his mind, to take him off from the thoughts of endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procure peace, and of quenching the fire that broke out ſnortly after. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſuggeſt to him, that that peace will be of no advantage to <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> having done his buſineſs with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> will turn his Arms againſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44266:78"/>the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> or againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or ſome other of his Neighbours; that the King of <hi>England</hi> had already withdrawn himſelf; that the Emperor, and whole Empire, ſtood for them; that they will force the moſt Chriſtian King to reſtore what he hath taken from his neighbours; and that in a word, it was the common intereſt of all Soveraign Princes, and of the Pope himſelf, to keep <hi>France</hi> in play and cut out work for his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which began equally to be ſuſpected byall.</p>
               <p>It was no hard matter for them to make impreſſion on the mind of <hi>Altieri,</hi> who had already fully eſpouſed their party, and who could not diſguiſe his ſecret diſcontent for the bitter morſels the French Ambaſſador had made him ſwallow. Inſomuch, that with much indifferency he let ſlip a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, wherein he might have gained ſo much eſteem; by diverting the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of a War, the commotions whereof are at preſent ſo fatal, both to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Church, and the repoſe of all <hi>Europe:</hi> and, as he had teſtified but little Joy for the Conqueſts which the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King had made for the Church in the United Provinces, ſo he ſhewed but little grief, either for the loſſes that followed, when his Majeſty united all his Forces to defend himſelf againſt his enemies.</p>
               <p>And theſe are, in my opinion, the moſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44266:79"/>conſiderable overtures, whereby Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi-Altieri</hi> might have acquired glory and reputation.</p>
               <p>But, all this hath contributed, not onely to make him loſe ſo many fair occaſions, but likewiſe to draw upon himſelf troubles; which we ſhall preſently ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>When in the beginning of this Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, men ſaw Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> inveſted in the name of <hi>Altieri,</hi> the quality of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and by conſequence in the authority that is annexed to it, they had ground to be perſwaded, that if his Miniſtry would not be very illuſtrious, it would at leaſt prove peaceable and quiet; it was preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that a Nephew by Favour, or Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not by Nature or Blood, which expoſed him for that reaſon to the envy of many, would ſo behave himſelf, that no man might have cauſe to except againſt him; that therefore he would make it his ſtudy to give content to allay, or at leaſt to avoid the occaſions of miſunderſtanding with the Miniſters of Princes. But fortune has this inſeparable property, that if ſhe raiſe a man all of a ſuddain, ſhe makes him forget what he owes, both to himſelf, and the reſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> is without doubt, a man of Wit and Senſe; but it is quickly found, that ſetting aſide his own Family, all other
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44266:79"/>men were nothing to him. Pride or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did not raiſe in him ſentiments of contempt; but his forwardneſs to make his Family, made him forget the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the rank which he held; all that he looked upon in the Papacy, was the great age of the Pope, and the means of making the beſt of his time for raiſing his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and becauſe he was perſwaded that his Reign would not laſt long, he reſolved to make the beſt uſe of it he could: that made him take ſhort meaſures, to make Hay whilſt the Sun did ſhine; and upon that principle he wholly neglected Forreign affairs, that he might apply himſelf to Domeſtick.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder then, that he made it his buſineſs to delay the granting of the demands that were made to him, that by the protracting of time, he might be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from his promiſe, if the Pope ſhould die, whilſt in the interim he made uſe of the time for the advancement of his own intereſts.</p>
               <p>For my part, this ſeems to me to have been the chief aim of his Conduct, which is ſufficiently to be diſcovered in his moſt remarkable actions: for what could he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, for inſtance; from the difficulties that he ſtarted upon the promotion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> from the delays he ſpun out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44266:80"/>in that of the Abbot <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> as he does ſtill in the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles;</hi> yea, and in the nomination of Crowns? unleſs it be, that the Pope who is old, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to die, he may be exempted from giving them ſatisfaction, whilſt in the mean time he fils the vacant places with others, who are at his Devotion.</p>
               <p>This maxime of making Hay whilſt the Sun ſhines, is very common in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> where men truſt much to time; and it often ſucceeds with Northern Nations, whom the <hi>Italians</hi> entertain with good words, and amuſe with trifles, until they be tired out with the length of time and delays, which to them is inſupportable; that ſo they may either remit their pretenſions, or that the face of affairs being changed by time, there remains no more engagement on either ſide.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> had found the benefit of that policy, if the Reign of <hi>Clement</hi> the X. had laſted but two or three years, he had already in a ſhort time made both himſelf and his Family; he had obtained for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Revenue of an hundred thouſand Crowns a year, by Charges, Benefices, and Penſions: Dom. <hi>Gaſparo Altieri</hi> his Brother, had almoſt as much; he had ſtrengthened his Family by the alliances which we have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44266:80"/>mentioned before; and though he had not many creatures in the ſacred Colledge, moſt of the Cardinals whom he had raiſed, being but little obliged to him for their promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and none of thoſe in whom he could confide, being Papable; yet it might have been eaſie for him to make a party in a Conclave, either by owning the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, or liſting himſelf among the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron Volant: if without the Eccleſiaſtick he had no good correſpondence with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet he had carried himſelf ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as not to fall into open variance with them: So that if the Pope had died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time, <hi>Altieri</hi> was warm enough, without being entangled with Soveraigns; and he was free from the reproach of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected the paſt conjunctures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſhort continuance of the Pope, would have ſerved him for an excuſe.</p>
               <p>But he forſaw not the conſequences, which that conduct, which only looks to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, draws after it.</p>
               <p>So that bad policy can only be attributed to ſo many troubleſome affairs, that many Miniſters in divers times, and in ſeveral ſtates have drawn upon themſelves: and not to trouble our ſelves with other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; we have a very formal and freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this in the perſon of Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:44266:81"/>upon occaſion of the late conteſt he hath had with the Miniſters of Crowns, and eſpecially with the Ambaſſador of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was no trouble to him on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to diſcontent the Sacred Colledge, by refuſing ſeveral Cardinals, the Favours or Benefices that they demanded for their Creatures, applying them all to himſelf; or having diſpoſed of them, only by the way of traffick that was ſetled in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: yea, and in many rencounters, it was but the leaſt of his ſtudy to comply with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and though he was wholly theirs, yet he hath let them ſee, that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt alone regulates his inclinations. But the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> have but little cauſe to be ſatisfied with him; and in a word, all Chriſtendom ſtands amazed at his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and coldneſs in the moſt preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. On all occaſions he hath ſhewed himſelf againſt <hi>France;</hi> but particularly in the proviſion of the Generalſhip of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>St. Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Dignity had been for ſome time vacant, and I pretend not to decide whoſe right it was to preſent to it; it is enough that the moſt Chriſtian King had a deſign of uniting that Order, and of erecting it into a new one, according to the Model
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44266:81"/>that had been made to the King: ſo that his Majeſty having already given a head to the Order, Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> judging that to be an enterpriſe againſt the Rights of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, was in ſome trouble, on whom he ſhould confer that Dignity, tho <hi>Rome</hi> be full of poor Churchmen, that ſeek their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; yet there are but few <hi>French</hi> there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of other Nations. The good Order of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy joyned to the priviledges of the Gallican Church, and the rights of Patronage, hinders them from wandring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Alps;</hi> and takes from them all hopes of making any advantage there, unleſs it be ſome <hi>Bretons,</hi> who obtain Curacies in their Provinces, though with much trouble, and moſt times without other ſucceſs, than the carrying home with them proviſions, the ſeeds of everlaſting Law-ſuits: ſome <hi>Gaſcons</hi> are likewiſe there, though with as bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as the others.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that there was no man that would accept of being Abbot and General of <hi>St. Lazarus,</hi> for fear of falling into ſome inconveniencies, by an action that might diſpleaſe the King: Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> made uſe of a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> Prieſt, who went by the Title of <hi>Abbot de la Colombiere,</hi> for filling of that place: having cauſed many fair of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of protection and ſupport to be made
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44266:82"/>to him, if he did accept it; the good Churchman being but a Novice in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of ſo quaint a Court as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who beſides had no Eſtate, ſued for the Abby, and obtained it againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of all the wiſe men of the Court, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the party of <hi>Altieri,</hi> who on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, encouraged him, and puffed him up with fair hopes.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> exaſperated againſt thoſe who ſerved as inſtruments to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of <hi>Altieri,</hi> could not refrain ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſentments: he ſent for the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that drew up the Petition, and having ſeverely chid him, cauſed him to be put in priſon; <hi>La Colombiere</hi> met with no better uſage, he was forced to lay down his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Benefice. But <hi>Altieri</hi> remaining firm, and the Datary refuſing to admit of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; he retired to the Popes Palace, where he ſtayed until his departure, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting by ſome aſſiſtance that he had from the Apoſtolick Palace. Some days after that, <hi>Altieri</hi> by abſolute authority, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scrivener to be relieved from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and complained highly of the liberty the Ambaſſador had taken, as of an attempt againſt the authority of the Soveraign, and againſt one, upon whom he had no juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Since that time <hi>La Colombiere,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44266:82"/>to the counſel of his friends, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>France,</hi> whether he had found that they were weary at the Palace of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him expences, or that he hoped to draw ſome Benefice from the Court, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the mortification of being ſhut up in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where he continues at preſent.</p>
               <p>And thus was that little debate in the year 1672. carried on, wherein waving the reflexions that might be made on the conduct of the Ambaſſador, who had all reaſon in the world to be offended; the boldneſs of theſe two little inconſiderable perſons of the Nation, which made them tranſgreſs the duty and reſpect due unto ſuch a Miniſter, cannot but be blamed; a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> would have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to have done the like.</p>
               <p>I thought it my duty to leave the whole matter to the conſideration of diſintereſſed perſons, that they may obſerve the manner of <hi>Altieri</hi>'s carriage, who might have let that matter ſleep without any prejudice to the Holy See, and ſtaytill he ſhould be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited from <hi>France;</hi> for the confirmation of the Kings deſign concerning the order of <hi>St, Lazarus,</hi> at which time he might have come off with more advantage, without increaſing the diſcontents of the Duke
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44266:83"/>
                  <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> yea, and of the King himſelf, who then beſtowed himſelf ſo uſefully for Religion, by the great exploits of his firſt Campagne in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This harſh proceeding was quickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by what happened, upon occaſion of the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ambaſſador concerned himſelf as much for baffling Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Intrigues, as for any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that he could have in that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as has been mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Much about the ſame time, the Duke <hi>d' Eſtrees</hi> diſcovered the puny commerce that was entertained between <hi>Altieri,</hi> and <hi>Bonviſi,</hi> the Nuncio at <hi>Cologne,</hi> whereof we have likewiſe ſpoken. And ſhortly after <hi>Altieri</hi> made appear his repugnancy, to the promotion of the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nomination of the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe thwartings of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy towards that Crown, appeared to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people ſo ſtrange, that they believed, and even gave it out, that the Nephew Regnant would not have proceeded to ſo many extremities, without the aſſiſtance of ſome one or other at Court, who backed him in his reſolutions againſt the Duke
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44266:83"/>
                  <hi>d' Eſtrees:</hi> they could not comprenend how the humour of <hi>Altieri,</hi> ſo averſe from enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in any difficult matter, that he even avoided coming to an open rupture with the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> though the Popes Subjects, could reſolve to ſtand it out ſo long againſt the Miniſter of ſo powerful a Monarch, who makes the greateſt ſhew at <hi>Rome,</hi> they concluded that he muſt needs have ſome body about his Majeſty, with whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſecret intelligence: and they have been curious enough, to confirm themſelves in their thoughts, as to make an exact ſearch of thoſe who might be ill-affected towards the Duke <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> and have drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from ſuch conſequences as they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>But all theſe imaginations are vain chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's. The moſt Chriſtian King is more faithfully ſerved by all, who have any hand in his affairs, than that any about his Majeſty can have the thoughts of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their private paſſion, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the affairs of ſuch a Maſter: and beſides the ſmall ſucceſs of other Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, evinces that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies as little with the Miniſters that are at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> as with thoſe that are at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> a ſure mark that he takes no great care to engage them.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:44266:84"/>
               <p>It muſt be then concluded, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in regard of <hi>France,</hi> is indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange; and that the reaſon of it muſt needs proceed from an old habit, heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry almoſt to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they have always promiſed themſelves anything from the facility of the <hi>French,</hi> in forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what is paſt, or from a generoſity that makes them think it below them to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at things which they meet with in a Court made up of Churchmen.</p>
               <p>And ſo much in reſpect of <hi>France.</hi> As for <hi>Spain,</hi> if that Nation has no great cauſe to complain, ſo neither have they much to brag on, of Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent what he did, to excuſe himſelf from making Father <hi>Nitard</hi> Cardinal, with the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtrees;</hi> and the vaſt penſions wherewith he chargeth the vacant Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Dominions of the Catholick King, ſufficiently prove, that his friendſhip is not without intereſt: it is nevertheleſs to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that he hath been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> witneſs his readineſs to engage in the matter of the election of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to follow the motions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> who diſſwaded him from concerning himſelf in the cauſe of the Prince of <hi>Fuſtemberg,</hi> though named to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44266:84"/>by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and accepted by the Pope: In a word, he hath in all conjunctures ſhewed, at leaſt a fear of offending, if he had no deſire to oblige them.</p>
               <p>Other Sovereigns have found him reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved enough at firſt, when they preſented themſelves to him, or intended to engage him to declare himſelf in matters that were liable to controverſie; but when they preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him home, they obtained what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and ſo carried their pretenſions, without being obliged to him. In this manner he carried himſelf with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> about the diſpute of the Bank of the River <hi>Po;</hi> with the Great Duke, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affair of the valley of <hi>Chiana;</hi> with the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> in the matter of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Genoa;</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> touching the difficulty of the Nunciature of Monſieur <hi>Durazzi;</hi> and even with the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, though the Popes Subjects, about the marriage of the Lady <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Lords have made appear, that he has no ſtrength, but againſt thoſe who retreat at his firſt reſiſtance; and that he eaſily yields, when he finds himſelf in the leaſt put to it, though the honor of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be ſomewhat concerned in it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he engages himſelf in matters that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44266:85"/>he cannot maintain. So that, if the Court of <hi>France</hi> had thought fit to ſtand it out with him; when he undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the Nuncio <hi>Bargellini,</hi> contrary to their inclination, that Prelate being well beloved there, all that could have been deſired might have been obtained. If it had been thought convenient to have preſſed him, concerning the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> in favour of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the affair had been ended.</p>
               <p>And if he hath condeſcended in all other occaſions, wherein his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has been willing to teſtifie a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, ſo it would be no hard matter to have ſatisfaction from him in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of affairs.</p>
               <p>He carried himſelf until the year 1674. in ſuch a manner, that if he neglected to make friends, yet he drew upon himſelf no open enemies; if he took no great care to content people; provided his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns went well, becauſe he had no other proſpect in a ſhort liv'd Pontificat; ſo thoſe that were diſcontented, forbore to ſhew their reſentments, upon the ſame conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that matters could not go long ſo. Moreover, he entertained one party with fair promiſes, and ſupported the other with diſſimulation; the conjuncture being likewiſe favourable to him in a time
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44266:85"/>of War and Rupture amongſt Chriſtian Princes, who avoided the occaſions of cutting themſelves out work at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſewhere, having enough to do at home.</p>
               <p>So that the Nephew Regnant might, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying, <hi>godere il papato,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Papacy at his eaſe; if he had not given a general provocation to all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt him.</p>
               <p>And this happened by an Edict which he cauſed to publiſh and poſt up, concerning the Cuſtoms and Duties of all Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Proviſions, Victuals, or other things that are paid at their entry into the Towns of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cardinals, forreign Miniſters and their Families or Domeſticks, are exempted from that duty of Entry, for the things they ſtand in need of, and are ſent them in from abroad: but ſome there are who extend that priviledge, farther than it ſhould reach, abuſing it; by managing ſome little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand traffick, either by bringing in Goods under their names, or by giving Letters or Patents which are called <hi>of Familiaritie,</hi> by virtue whereof, they, who have them, enjoy the priviledge, as if they were the ſervants of ſuch an Ambaſſador, or ſuch a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:44266:86"/>
               <p>The Farmers of the Cuſtoms have often complained of theſe abuſes, have demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abatements of their Farm, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the prejudice that ariſes to the Apoſtolick chamber, from the knavery practiſed by ſeveral Officers of Cardinals and Ambaſſadors in that matter. It hath been often conſidered, how that abuſe might be remedied: but no means could be as yet found out, which did not occaſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, quarrels, and very many times vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences againſt the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have been badly uſed, or threatened by the priviledged.</p>
               <p>About the end of the year 1674. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altieri</hi> perceiving that the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was the Holy year; there would be great confluence of people at <hi>Rome,</hi> who would flock thither from all parts, to gain the univerſal Jubile; and that by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, more Goods and Proviſions than commonly, would be brought thither; had a mind to make his advantage of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and conſiderably, to raiſe the Farm of them: the chief Farmer offered him a good ſum of Money, with a conſiderable parcel of Wine, which in <hi>Italy</hi> is called <hi>Paraguanto,</hi> if for that year he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the priviledges and exemptions, granted to perſons of all quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44266:86"/>Preſently came abroad a very ample Edict, conform to the intention of the former, and was poſted up on the uſual places of the City, without acquainting thoſe that are concerned therein.</p>
               <p>The whole Colledge of Cardinals, all the forreign Miniſters with their ſervants, who by the Edict were deprived of their priviledges, are ſurprized at ſuch an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: they make preſently great noiſe, enter into conferences, and unite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> takes no notice of any thing, but lets them grumble and ſtir: he is told that <hi>Rome</hi> is in a general confuſion; is threatened with ſome dangerous revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he makes anſwer, that the Pope is Maſter at home: Meſſengers are ſent to the Palace, to carry the grievances direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Holineſs, and under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, he hinders them from having Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Emperor, the moſt Chriſtian King, the Catholick King, and of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> finding him ſo inſenſible of their firſt motions, agree to goe with their Retinues, in company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to an extraordinary Audience of his Holineſs, without dependance on the Cardinal Nephew, and reſolve to be heard at what rate ſoever: they ſet out at the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44266:87"/>ſame time, go to the Pallace of <hi>Montecaval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and there preſent themſelves; but, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri,</hi> who was there, being informed of their March, cauſes the Gates to be ſhut, and the Chains drawn croſs the Streets: he complains of that new way of coming to Audience, without acquainting either the Pope or himſelf; that it is a ſurpriſe, an aſſault, a kind of violence, and of moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to the reſpect that is due to the Popes perſon, and the auguſt place that contains ſo ſacred a pledge.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadours return full of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, have their meetings together, and conſult to attaque the Cardinal Nephew in the moſt ſenſible part of his Nepotiſme; they reſolve to take no more notice of him in the Affairs of their Miniſtery; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the honour they do him, in communicating to him the reſult of their ordinary Audiences; and, in fine, to look upon him no other wayes but as another private Cardinal of the Colledge. With this Project they intend to acquaint their Maſters; and that it may not ſeem a thing affected to gratifie a private Paſſion, or to put a trick upon the Nephew, they all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to ſigne the Copy of the Relation which they ſhould ſend to their ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with this formality, that the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44266:87"/>which ſhould go to <hi>France</hi> ſhould be ſigned by Cardinal <hi>Langrave,</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſador, Cardinal <hi>Nitard</hi> the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, and the Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice;</hi> that that which was to be ſent to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be ſigned by the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees,</hi> and the others; and, in the ſame manner the reſt that ſhould be ſent to <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> That was an expedient, to avoid the difficulty of Signing all the ſame Relation, which could not be done, becauſe the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> would not have Signed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the French Ambaſſadour, who is in poſſeſſion of the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus performed, and the Miniſters being approved by their Maſters, as to what they had reſolved: in the firſt Audience which they had at the Palace, they repreſented to the Pope, the cauſes which they had of diſcontent, the Actions of the Nephew in prejudice of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; the abuſes to which he engaged the authority as well as goodneſs of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the Injury done to their Character, and the reſentment they were forced to teſtifie of it, without hurting their reſpect and duty towards the Holy See, which their Maſters knew well to diſtinguiſh from the bad Government of Cardinal <hi>Altieri:</hi> they declared to his Holineſs, that they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44266:88"/>not to do violence to his inclination, and to the affection he had for Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> but that they could do very well without depending on him, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their miniſtery, whereof he had evidenced ſo ſmall eſteem, by all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in what had already paſt.</p>
               <p>The Pope laboured as much as in him lay to pacifie them; and to Juſtifie the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, he repreſented to them the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Apoſtolick Chamber, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in more than Eight and forty Millions of Gold at his coming to the Pontificat; that the ſuſpenſion of the Priviledges and Exemptions, was onely for the Holy year, which engaged the Chamber ſtill to more extraordinary charges: and that moreover Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> and he, had ſhewen their Moderation, becauſe that under his Reign the Eccleſiaſtick State had not been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any new impoſition, a thing which has not happened under many Popes of theſe laſt Ages.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and ſuch like Diſcourſes of the Pope, which tended onely to Juſtifie the Nephew, had not the effect which he could have wiſhed. The Audiences being ended, the Ambaſſadours returned home without going to the Apartment of the Nephew, as the cuſtom is; treated no more with him
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44266:88"/>about any buſineſs; and took from him the name of <hi>Altieri,</hi> calling him onely <hi>Paluzzi</hi> in the Titles they gave him, when occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of ſpeaking to him.</p>
               <p>This continued for ſome time, but the Nephew fearing the conſequences of an affair of that nature, and finding that it drew upon him the contempt of all the Roman Court, and even of the People, who, when they are diſcontented, many times imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the more powerful, that they may ſhake off their obedience; that Potentates gave no more anſwers to his Letters, wherewith he accompanied the Briefs of his Holineſs; that, in fine, being no more reſpected of the great Men, he became the object of the Peoples deriſion, or the compaſſion of his Friends: he cauſed a Congregation to be eſtabliſhed of unſuſpected Cardinals, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the means of giving ſatisfaction to the Forreign Miniſters, with as much ſafety to his honour as poſſibly could be had.</p>
               <p>I may ſay by the by, that they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer to Congregations, affairs that they would have prolonged, and I never ſaw any thing determined by them: they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Men that affect neutrality; but, who are however naturally more inclined to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44266:89"/>thoſe who have given them the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if any of them abſent themſelves, whole moneths paſs over before they meet again, and if death, or any accident carry any one of them off, time is required to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another to be put into the place of him that is gone; in a word, the Papacy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expires before they conclude any thing, let the matter of their Deputation be never ſo eaſie.</p>
               <p>The Congregation that <hi>Altieri</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſatisfaction of the Ambaſſadors, propoſed ſeveral expedients, to which they agreed not; when the revocation of the Edict was propoſed, they ſaid, that that would be reckoned no ſatisfaction to them, ſeeing the Pope was obliged to do ſo in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and that though he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, yet there were but few Officers of the Cuſtoms that durſt yenture to put it in execution againſt the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In effect, whether the Cuſtomers had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Palace, to deſiſt from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, or that they feared ſome harſh u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they altered nothing in the matter of exemptions: And, one day, ſome Packs and Boxes being ſent to Cardinal <hi>Sforza,</hi> and the Carriers being gone to diſcharge and put them into the Cuſtom-houſe; his Eminence was offended that they were not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44266:89"/>ſent ſoon enough home to him; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went to the Cuſtom-houſe, and cauſed them to be carried away, threatning the Popes Officers, without any notice taken thereof in the Palace.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Congregation was buſie in managing ſome accommodation; the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours contrived among themſelves wayes to highten more and more their pretenſions, and vex the Nephew; they not onely forbore treating with him, but alſo if they met him in the Town, they cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their Coaches to ſtop, as the cuſtom is, but went on without compliment or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. So that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> being one day gone abroad to make ſome viſit, and perceiving the French Ambaſſadors Coach coming at a diſtance, he cauſed the Toſſels to be quickly taken off his Horſes, that he might paſs <hi>incognito,</hi> and ſo avoid the ſhame of ſeeing the Ambaſſador paſs by without receiving the uſual civility.</p>
               <p>That which ſurpriſed him moſt, was, the ſtedfaſtneſs of all the Miniſters linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to croſs him, in a time when the Princes their Maſters were ſo hot in action againſt one another; he could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the Ambaſſadors of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and <hi>Spain</hi> continued ſo addicted to ſecond the French Miniſter, who was the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44266:90"/>moſt incenſed of all, and who drave the matter fartheſt.</p>
               <p>He let the debate reſt ſome time, to ſee if they would give over, but perceiving that he gained nothing by that courſe, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured underhand to draw off from the party the Cardinals of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Nitard;</hi> they deſired time to communicate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that were made them, to <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> that they might thereupon have the opinions of their Princes, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned themſelves in the difference. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the matter coming into negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on each ſide, they yielded all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and condeſcended to the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they had diſputed, and wherein they found no other advantage, at leaſt that hath been apparent, but a weak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Cardinal <hi>Nitard,</hi> that it was never in his thoughts to offend them, and that he was diſpleaſed at what had paſſed, which he did in a viſit that was rendered him by the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor and <hi>Spain,</hi> where they owned him for the Popes Nephew, and in that quality treated with him.</p>
               <p>They proceeded not in that, without imparting their reſolution to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and it was no difficult matter for them to draw the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44266:90"/>into their party, who might very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſt contented with the ſatisfaction that pleaſed the other two: But, the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> let them take their courſe, and told them that his Maſter had other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions and motives not to be content with the conduct of <hi>Altieri;</hi> that though the ſatisfaction which they accepted were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to repare what had happened upon the account of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dict (which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could hardly be perſwaded of) yet he would not admit of it, unleſs he had the other ſatisfactions which the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his due.</p>
               <p>It is not known by what Maxim of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> ſo ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their pretenſions, ſeeing they have the eſteem not to let go their hold eaſily, and to be more firm and ſtedfaſt than the French, eſpecially in matter of reſentment and revenge; the Politicks of that change, after ſo publick and ſolemn declarations, cannot be obſerved. All that can be ſaid of it, is, that by ſo low a compliance they intended to make their Court, and leave the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> in the lurch.</p>
               <p>Some, without any ground, have been pleaſed to ſay, that Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> gained
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44266:91"/>the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by giving them hopes of aſſiſting them under-hand for the recovery of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> or that at leaſt they yielded eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, that by gaining the Pope in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to <hi>Altieri,</hi> they believed they might hamper the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees,</hi> and put him in the wrong, giving out that the <hi>French</hi> Nation is never content, that they are troubleſome every where, and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable in all places where they can have footing. This they put the <hi>Italians</hi> in head of; but they are not now adayes ſo apt to believe theſe ſuggeſtions; ſeeing it is a Proverb with them, that <hi>Sono morti tutti i mutti franceſi, e tutti i ſavy ſpagnuoli:</hi> That all the <hi>French</hi> Fooles are dead, and all the Wiſe <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have proofes of this by the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and wiſe conduct which the King has held at <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome time, wherein that Court has perceived that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to be got of the <hi>French,</hi> by the Maxim heretofore obſerved, of tiring them out by length of time, and ſo prevailing on their natural impatience.</p>
               <p>This hath made Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> yield, and to uſe the recommendations and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Friends with his Majeſty, in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44266:91"/>preſent affaires; from which, good ſucceſs may be expected, if the Pope live any time, and when he ſhall die, it will give a great ſtroak for the ſatisfaction of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in a Court which is wholly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by example, and in the moſt important deliberations looks alwayes back to what hath been done in times paſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Cardinals may be again divided into Papable and not Papable.</p>
               <p>The Papable Cardinals are ſuch as have all the qualities commonly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for being Pope, and who have not thoſe which exclude a Man from the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</p>
               <p>The qualities commonly requiſite for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope, are good Manners, at leaſt the appearance of a pious and religious Life, a prudent and wiſe conduct, free from paſſion and extravagancies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An advanced Age, above Fifty years at leaſt, or otherwayes a conſtitution that promiſes no long Reign, nor vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, for men are content that a Pope give himſelf to a quiet life, or as the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſay, <hi>Attenda a vivere e Laſci vivere,</hi> Live and let live; and that it may not

               <p n="3">3. Kindred of a mild and diſcreet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for avoiding the inconveniences of the Pontificat of <hi>Alex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nder</hi> the VI, <hi>Paul</hi> the IV. and of ſeveral others; for the Plots and Conſpiracies of the Duke of <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> the ſon of the firſt, and the bad acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Caraffa's,</hi> the Nephews of the ſecond, are very well known. This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſſential point now adayes to render a man Papable, ſince the Nephews have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much authority in governing and diſpoſing of all matters under the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat of their Unckles. In ſo much, that when any one is propoſed to be made Pope, they caſt their eyes immediately upon their Kindred, and, if I may ſo ſay, examine more carefully their lives, than the life of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Propoſed. That hindered Cardinal <hi>Bonviſi,</hi> a Man otherwayes moſt Papable, from mounting the Pontifical Throne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was feared that Monſieur <hi>Bonviſi</hi> his Nephew might Reign, whoſe haughty, fierce, arrogant, and unſociable humour, was had in averſion by all the Court. The number of the Kindred is likewiſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe many Relations about a Pope
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44266:98"/>drain the Treaſure of the Apoſtolick cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ruine the Eccleſiaſtick State (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready indebted in more than Fifty Millions of <hi>Roman</hi> Crowns) by building of Palaces, buying Eſtates, and making themſelves Princes.</p>
               <p>The Qualities which exclude a man from the Papacy, are hereafter deduced, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Cardinals who are not Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals not Papable are ſuch as have ſome quality which excludes them from the Papacy.</p>
               <p>Theſe qualities are either eſſential or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental.</p>
               <p>The eſſential are linked either to their Perſon, or Character, as being born Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of a Soveraign Houſe; this is a ſtrong conſideration; becauſe it is to be feared, that if a Cardinal Prince were made Pope, he would alienate the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and diſmember it, that he might beſtow the ſame on ſome or other of his houſe; that he would tranſgreſs the Neutrality which a common Father ſhould obſerve with all Chriſtian Princes, it being hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that a Pope born a Prince ſhould want engagements, by the Tie of blood and the Intereſts of his houſe: to this may be added, that the Cardinals and Prelates
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44266:99"/>have ground to apprehend, that a Pope, born a Prince, might treat them too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly, and deſpiſe them.</p>
               <p>Another quality which renders a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal not Papable, is to have been promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the nomination of ſome Crown, and eſpecially of that of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe, if he came to be Pope, he would in gratitude, be obliged to depend much on the ſentiments of him, to whom he owed his fortune.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of a Cardinal, who is in the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, or who is a Native of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> for that reaſon, excludes likewiſe from the Pontificat. I give not all the inſtances that might more confirm the veritie of thoſe maxims.</p>
               <p>It is known of freſh date, that <hi>Vidoni</hi> was not Pope in the laſt Conclave, becauſe he was made Cardinal at the nomination of the King of <hi>Poland, John Caſimir,</hi> who was ſince retired into <hi>France,</hi> which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence gave Umbrage to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Chigi,</hi> though he was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and of the creation of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. the Uncle of <hi>Chigi.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44266:99"/>
               <p>This ſerves to make good the ſecond maxim; and as to the Firſt, it has been ſeen, that the Family of the <hi>Roucre</hi> has been Sovereign in the Eccleſiaſtick State, becauſe there have been two Popes of that Houſe: and the Houſe of <hi>Medicis</hi> is ariſen to that powerful pitch, wherein it now is, by the ſupport of the Popes of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>The accidental qualities which exclude from the Pontificat, are many in number; but they are all almoſt reduceable to thoſe which are contrary to the qualities that render a man Papable, as, the Manners, Conduct, Age, and Kindred. Cardinal <hi>Toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> miſſed of being Pope, becauſe he was too free in his Speech, and had almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his mouth a certain word, which did not ſute with a man of his character, though it be very common amongſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Lombards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Age, beſides that that is much lookt upon in <hi>Italy</hi> for all charges, it is particularly eyed for the Pontificat; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the conſequences that attend it; to wit, Gravity, Reverence, Veneration, Authority, and many other conſiderations which are annexed to old Age.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:44266:100"/>
               <p>As to the Kindred, we have the inſtance of the ill-inſtructed Children of <hi>Eli</hi> the High-Prieſt, who occaſion'd the ſcandal mention'd in Scripture, by their gluttony and avarice, and brought down the Curſe of God upon themſelves and their Father. I ſhall not inſtance the modern examples of Nephews, who behave themſelves in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>There are many other reflexions that may be made on more remote qualities, which very many times do no leſs exclude a Cardinal from the Papacy; for, at <hi>Rome,</hi> every thing is ript up, as if by his conduct he hath offended the French or Spaniards, or thoſe who have moſt voices in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Pope, if he be partial as to any one, and a thouſand other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having, in general conſidered the Cardinals according to their different Factions, and the qualities that may give them hopes to aſpire to the Pontificat, or that exclude them from it: my deſign was to give the curious a third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Cardinals, that at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Sacred Colledge, who may aſpire to the triple Crown, or who may not; expoſing to view the particular qualities of every one of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44266:100"/>them, which render them worthy of, or exclude them from that Supreame degree. But, ſome private conſiderations concurring with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of many worthy people, whoſe inſtances I could not reject, are the cauſe why I ſeparate that work from this preſent Book, promiſing to publiſh it with the firſt opportunity, together with the Intrigue of the Miniſters of Crowns.</hi>
